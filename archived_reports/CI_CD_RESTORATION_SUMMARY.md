# CI/CD Pipeline Restoration Summary

## Date: August 3, 2025

### Problem Statement
The CI/CD pipeline was failing with the error:
```
npm ci can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync
```

This was blocking all automated testing and preventing merge of critical email pipeline improvements.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Package Manager Mismatch**: The project uses pnpm locally but CI was configured to use npm
2. **Lock File Desync**: After updating vitest from ^1.2.0 to ^3.2.4, only pnpm-lock.yaml was updated
3. **Version Incompatibility**: pnpm-lock.yaml was created with lockfileVersion 9.0, but CI initially tried to use pnpm v8

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Migrated CI/CD from npm to pnpm
- Updated all GitHub Actions jobs to use pnpm instead of npm
- Changed cache strategy from "npm" to "pnpm"
- Replaced all `npm ci` with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Replaced all `npm run` with `pnpm run`

#### 2. Fixed pnpm Setup Order
- Moved pnpm/action-setup@v4 before actions/setup-node@v4
- This ensures pnpm is available when Node.js setup tries to use it for caching

#### 3. Updated pnpm Version
- Changed from pnpm v8 to v9 to match lockfileVersion 9.0
- Ensures compatibility with the existing pnpm-lock.yaml

#### 4. Removed package-lock.json
- Deleted the outdated package-lock.json from git
- Now using only pnpm-lock.yaml for consistency

### Results
✅ **CI/CD Pipeline Restored**: Dependencies now install successfully in all jobs
✅ **Package Manager Consistency**: Development and CI both use pnpm
✅ **Version Compatibility**: pnpm v9 correctly reads lockfileVersion 9.0

### Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **ESLint Errors**: 16 code quality issues need fixing
2. **Unit Test Failures**: 75 test suites failing (pre-existing)
3. **Security Audit**: Some vulnerabilities reported (can be addressed separately)

### Commits Made
1. `1dda841` - fix: resolve vitest dependency conflict blocking CI/CD
2. `169df69` - fix: migrate CI/CD pipeline from npm to pnpm
3. `dfbed70` - fix: move pnpm setup before Node.js setup for proper caching
4. `df851a1` - fix: update CI to use pnpm version 9 to match lockfile version

### Next Steps
1. Fix ESLint errors to get linting job passing
2. Address failing unit tests
3. Consider adding `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual CI runs
4. Update documentation to reflect pnpm usage

### Lessons Learned
- Always ensure CI uses the same package manager as development
- Lock file versions must match between local and CI environments
- Action order matters in GitHub workflows (pnpm must be set up before Node.js when using pnpm caching)
