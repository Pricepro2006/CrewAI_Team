### 10. WebSocket Real-time Updates
**Status: ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE**

Severe WebSocket issues detected:
- **Error**: Connection to ws://localhost:3002/trpc-ws fails continuously
- **Impact**: Infinite reconnection loop causing:
  - React "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
  - 500+ connection attempts in seconds
  - Browser performance degradation
  - Console flooding with errors
- **Root Cause**: WebSocket server not running on port 3002

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. WebSocket Infrastructure Failure (CRITICAL)
**Severity: HIGH**
- WebSocket server not running on port 3002
- Causes infinite reconnection loop
- Prevents all real-time features
- Degrades application performance

**Console Errors:**
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3002/trpc-ws' failed
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded
GROCERY_WS Connecting/Disconnecting loop
```

### 2. Missing tRPC Mutation
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- NLP processing fails with missing mutation error
- Path: 'walmartGrocery.processGroceryInput'
- Prevents natural language grocery list creation

### 3. Data Loading Issues
**Severity: LOW**
- Price history trends stuck loading
- Some async data fetches incomplete

---

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times (Observed)
- Product search: ~200ms ✅
- Filter application: Instant ✅
- Add to cart: ~100ms ✅
