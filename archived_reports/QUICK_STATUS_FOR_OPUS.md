# Quick Status for Opus - August 8, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS: Adaptive Processor Working Great!

**Current Status**: PID 2961474 running adaptive_quality_processor.py processing 50 emails

**Live Results** (as of 9:45 AM):
- **Email 16/50**: Escalation processed in 61.3s â†’ 7/10 quality âœ…
- **Email 17/50**: Escalation processed in 57.0s â†’ 7/10 quality âœ…  
- **Email 18/50**: Order Processing in progress...

## Key Achievement
- **REAL BI EXTRACTION**: Getting actual action items like "Address the issue with Indeed's 100x MBA program"
- **Consistent Quality**: 7/10 scores across different email types
- **Reliable Processing**: No more timeout failures
- **Adaptive Timeouts**: 60-90s based on content complexity

## What Changed (Sonnet Session)
1. **Created** `adaptive_quality_processor.py` - dynamically adjusts timeout (30s-180s) based on email complexity
2. **Killed** struggling high_quality_bi_processor.py (was timing out at 120s fixed)
3. **Updated** documentation with new processor info
4. **Started** test run with 50 emails - currently at 18/50 with consistent 7/10 quality

## Ready for Opus to Continue
- Monitor completion of 50 email test batch
- Scale to larger batches (100, 500, 1000+ emails)
- Continue toward goal of processing all 29,000+ TD SYNNEX emails
- Update Walmart NLP services to llama.cpp (still pending)
