# üß™ Walmart Grocery Agent Comprehensive Test Report

**Test Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Test Environment:** localhost:5175 (Vite Dev Server)  
**Browser:** Playwright MCP Browser  
**Database:** walmart_grocery.db  

## Executive Summary

The Walmart Grocery Agent UI testing revealed a mix of functional features with **real database data** and critical issues that prevent full functionality. The system successfully displays actual data from the database (161 products, 25 orders, $82.45 saved) but suffers from severe WebSocket connection issues and routing problems.

## Database Verification ‚úÖ

**CONFIRMED: Real data from walmart_grocery.db is being displayed**
- 161 unique products tracked
- 25 orders from March-August 2025
- 229 order line items
- 6 store locations in South Carolina
- $82.45 total savings calculated from actual price data

## Test Results by Tab

### 1. Shopping Tab ‚úÖ PARTIALLY WORKING

**Working Features:**
- Search functionality returns real database results
- Searched for "eggs" returned 2 actual products:
  - Great Value Large White Eggs 18ct ($4.98)
  - Eggland's Best Large Eggs 12ct ($3.88)
- Product cards display actual prices and details from database
- Category filters are displayed (but untested)
- UI is responsive and clean

**Issues:**
- No add to cart functionality visible
- No inventory status shown
- Missing product images

### 2. Smart Search Tab ‚ùå BROKEN

**Critical Issues:**
- tRPC endpoint `walmartGrocery.hybridSearch` returns 404
- Error: "No 'mutation'-procedure on path 'walmartGrocery.hybridSearch'"
- Hybrid search service exists but not properly connected
- Quick search endpoint also returns 404

**Root Cause:** 
- Router is registered but client can't resolve endpoints
- Possible race condition in tRPC initialization

### 3. Grocery List Tab ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE

**Severe Issues:**
- WebSocket connection enters infinite loop
- Rapid connect/disconnect cycle (100+ attempts per second)
- Error: "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established"
- UI shows perpetual "Connecting" status
- Console flooded with connection errors

**Root Cause:**
- Client uses tRPC WebSocket client (`createWSClient`)
- Server provides plain WebSocket (not tRPC)
- Protocol mismatch causes immediate disconnection

**Fix Available:** useGroceryWebSocketFixed.ts created but not implemented

### 4. Budget Tracker Tab ‚ùå ROUTING BROKEN

**Issue:**
- URL changes to /walmart/budget
- Content remains Shopping tab
- No budget tracking features visible
- Component routing not working

**Screenshot:** budget-tracker-wrong-content.png

### 5. Price History Tab ‚ùå ROUTING BROKEN

**Issue:**
- URL changes to /walmart/price-history
- Content remains Shopping tab
- No price history charts or data visible
- Same routing issue as Budget Tracker

**Screenshot:** price-history-wrong-content.png

### 6. Live Pricing Tab ‚ùå ROUTING BROKEN

**Issue:**
- URL changes to /walmart/live-pricing
- Content remains Shopping tab
- No real-time pricing features visible
- Routing system completely broken for sub-routes

**Screenshot:** live-pricing-wrong-content.png

## Console Error Analysis

### Critical Errors Detected:

1. **WebSocket Connection Loop**
   ```
   WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8080/ws/walmart' failed
   WebSocket is closed before the connection is established
   ```
   - Frequency: Continuous (100+ per second)
   - Impact: Severe performance degradation

2. **tRPC Endpoint Failures**
   ```
   No 'mutation'-procedure on path 'walmartGrocery.hybridSearch'
   No 'mutation'-procedure on path 'walmartGrocery.quickSearch'
   ```
   - Impact: Smart Search completely non-functional

3. **React Maximum Update Depth**
   ```
   Maximum update depth exceeded
   ```
   - Caused by WebSocket reconnection loop
   - Triggers React re-render cycles

4. **Vite WebSocket Error**
   ```
   WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:24678/?token=...' failed
   Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 400
   ```
   - Vite HMR connection issue (non-critical)

## Data Flow Verification

### Confirmed Real Data Sources:
- ‚úÖ Product search results from walmart_grocery.db
- ‚úÖ Statistics (161 products, $82.45 saved) from database
- ‚úÖ Order count (25 orders) from orders table
- ‚úÖ Product prices and details from walmart_products table

### Not Working:
- ‚ùå WebSocket real-time updates
- ‚ùå Smart search with hybrid data sources
- ‚ùå Budget tracking calculations
- ‚ùå Price history visualization
- ‚ùå Live pricing updates

## Critical Issues Summary

1. **WebSocket Protocol Mismatch** (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)
   - Fix exists but not implemented
   - Prevents all real-time features
   - Causes severe performance issues

2. **React Router Sub-Route Failure** (SEVERITY: HIGH)
   - 4 of 6 tabs show wrong content
   - Routing configuration broken
   - Navigation non-functional

3. **tRPC Endpoint Resolution** (SEVERITY: HIGH)
   - Smart Search completely broken
   - API endpoints not accessible
   - Client-server communication failure

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix WebSocket Connection (PRIORITY 1)**
   - Implement useGroceryWebSocketFixed.ts in components
   - Replace tRPC WebSocket client with native WebSocket
   - Test connection stability

2. **Fix React Router Configuration (PRIORITY 2)**
   - Review route definitions in WalmartGroceryAgent component
   - Ensure proper outlet rendering for sub-routes
   - Test all tab navigation

3. **Resolve tRPC Endpoints (PRIORITY 3)**
   - Debug client-side tRPC initialization
   - Verify server-side router registration
   - Add proper error boundaries

4. **Add Missing Features**
   - Implement add to cart functionality
   - Add inventory status indicators
   - Include product images

## Positive Findings

Despite the issues, several aspects work well:

1. **Real Database Integration** - Successfully queries and displays actual data
2. **UI Design** - Clean, professional interface with good visual hierarchy
3. **Search Functionality** - Basic search works with real results
4. **Performance** - Fast database queries (when not affected by WebSocket loop)
5. **Statistics** - Accurate calculations from real order data

## Test Conclusion

The Walmart Grocery Agent has a solid foundation with **real database integration** confirmed, but critical infrastructure issues prevent it from being production-ready. The WebSocket connection loop is a severe issue that must be resolved immediately as it affects overall application performance. The routing system needs complete debugging to enable access to 67% of the features.

**Current Functionality Score: 2/10**
- Only 1 of 6 tabs partially functional
- Critical real-time features broken
- Severe performance issues from WebSocket loop

**Data Authenticity Score: 10/10**
- All displayed data confirmed from real database
- No hardcoded values detected
- Proper database integration verified
