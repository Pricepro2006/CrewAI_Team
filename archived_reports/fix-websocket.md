# WebSocket & tRPC Endpoint Fix

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. WebSocket Connection Issue
**Problem:** Client connects then immediately disconnects
**Cause:** Mismatch between client expectations (tRPC WebSocket) and server implementation (plain WebSocket)

The client uses `createWSClient` from `@trpc/client` which expects a tRPC WebSocket endpoint, but the server at port 8080 is a plain WebSocket server.

### 2. Missing tRPC Endpoint
**Problem:** `No 'mutation'-procedure on path 'walmartGrocery.hybridSearch'`
**Cause:** The router is registered but the import path was incorrect

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: WebSocket Client Configuration
The client needs to use a plain WebSocket connection instead of tRPC WebSocket for the standalone server on port 8080.

```typescript
// In useGroceryWebSocket.ts, replace the tRPC WebSocket client with:
const ws = new WebSocket(WS_URL);
```

### Fix 2: tRPC Router Registration
The walmart-grocery.router.ts file is properly registered in the main router.

## Verification Steps
1. WebSocket server is running on port 8080 ✅
2. Health endpoint responds: http://localhost:8080/health ✅
3. Router is registered in appRouter ✅
4. Client needs plain WebSocket connection (not tRPC WS)
