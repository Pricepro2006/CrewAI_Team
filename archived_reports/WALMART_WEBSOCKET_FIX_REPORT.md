# Walmart Grocery Agent - WebSocket Configuration Fix Report
## Date: August 12, 2025
## Issue Resolution Summary

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved the WebSocket port configuration mismatch identified during UI testing. The WebSocket server is now running on the correct port (8080) as documented in the review, addressing the discrepancy between the review claims and actual implementation.

---

## Issue Identified

### Original Problem
- **Review Document** (`WALMART_AGENT_POST_FIX_REVIEW_2025.md`) claimed WebSocket was fixed and running on port 8080
- **Actual State**: WebSocket server was not running, and frontend was configured for port 3002
- **Impact**: Complete failure of all real-time features

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Multiple conflicting port configurations across different files
2. WebSocket server existed but was not started
3. Frontend hardcoded to wrong port (3002 instead of 8080)
4. Configuration mismatch between documentation and implementation

---

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Port Configuration Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `/src/ui/hooks/useGroceryWebSocket.ts` - Updated from port 3002 to 8080
- `/src/ui/hooks/useTRPCWithCSRF.ts` - Updated WebSocket URL to port 8080
- `/src/config/websocket.config.ts` - Fixed dynamic port calculation to use 8080

**Changes Applied:**
```typescript
// Before
const WS_URL = `ws://localhost:3002/trpc-ws`;

// After  
const WS_URL = `ws://localhost:8080/ws/walmart`;
```

### 2. WebSocket Server Startup
**Command Executed:**
```bash
WEBSOCKET_PORT=8080 npx tsx src/api/websocket/server.ts
```

**Server Status:**
- ✅ Successfully started on port 8080
- ✅ Health check endpoint active at http://localhost:8080/health
- ✅ WebSocket endpoint available at ws://localhost:8080/ws/walmart

### 3. Verification Results
**Health Check Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "websocket": {
    "port": 8080,
    "connections": 0
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-12T15:06:30.592Z"
}
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **Port Configuration**: All WebSocket configurations now correctly point to port 8080
2. **Server Running**: WebSocket server successfully started and accepting connections
3. **No More Connection Refused Errors**: Frontend can now reach the WebSocket server

### ⚠️ Remaining Issue
**Protocol Mismatch**: While the WebSocket server is running and accepting connections, there's a protocol incompatibility:
- Frontend uses tRPC's `createWSClient` which expects tRPC WebSocket protocol
- Server implements a custom WebSocket protocol for Walmart-specific messages
- Result: Connections establish but immediately disconnect due to protocol mismatch

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
[INFO] New WebSocket client connected: ws_1755011439748_qa8d1smip
[INFO] Client disconnected: ws_1755011439748_qa8d1smip
```

## Impact Assessment

### Working Features (After Fix)
- ✅ Application loads without WebSocket connection refused errors
- ✅ No more infinite reconnection loops crashing the browser
- ✅ Core functionality (search, cart, budget) works without WebSocket
- ✅ Database connectivity and API calls functioning

### Features Still Affected
- ❌ Real-time price updates
- ❌ Live inventory changes
- ❌ WebSocket-based notifications
- ❌ NLP processing status updates

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Protocol Alignment**: Either:
   - Option A: Implement tRPC WebSocket protocol in the server
   - Option B: Update frontend to use native WebSocket instead of tRPC's client
   
2. **Testing**: Once protocol is aligned, test all real-time features

### Configuration Documentation
**Correct Port Configuration:**
- WebSocket Server: Port 8080
- WebSocket Endpoint: ws://localhost:8080/ws/walmart
- API Server: Port 3001
- Frontend Dev Server: Port 5173

---

## Conclusion

The WebSocket port configuration issue has been successfully resolved, confirming that the server should indeed run on port 8080 as stated in the review document. While a protocol mismatch prevents full functionality, the critical infrastructure issue has been addressed, and the system is now closer to the documented architecture.

**Next Step**: Align the WebSocket protocol between frontend and backend to enable full real-time functionality.
