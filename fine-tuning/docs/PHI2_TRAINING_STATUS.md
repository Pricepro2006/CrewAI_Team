## Key Files

### Active Training Scripts
1. **train_phi2_fixed.py** - Currently running script with:
   - Proper label setup for loss computation
   - Custom ProgressCallback for monitoring
   - Memory optimization with gradient checkpointing
   - Immediate output flushing

2. **monitor_training.py** - Real-time training monitor with:
   - Process tracking
   - Progress bar visualization
   - ETA calculation
   - Resource usage display

3. **phase4_evaluation_phi2.py** - Evaluation framework for:
   - Comparing against Claude's ground truth
   - Multi-factor scoring (entities, workflows, insights)
   - 70% accuracy threshold for deployment

## Training Objective

Fine-tune Phi-2 to match Claude's comprehensive email analysis capabilities:

### Target Capabilities
1. **Entity Extraction** (30% weight)
   - PO numbers, quotes, invoice numbers
   - Customer names and contacts
   - Product identifiers

2. **Workflow Detection** (25% weight)
   - START, IN-PROGRESS, COMPLETION states
   - Chain completeness scoring
   - Action item identification

3. **Business Intelligence** (25% weight)
   - Financial insights
   - Strategic recommendations
   - Risk assessments

4. **Summary Generation** (20% weight)
   - Concise executive summaries
   - Key metrics extraction

## Next Steps

### Immediate (During Training)
- [x] Monitor training progress every 30 minutes
- [x] Check loss convergence
- [ ] Prepare evaluation scripts

### Post-Training (After ~6.5 hours)
- [ ] Run phase4_evaluation_phi2.py
- [ ] Compare outputs against Claude's ground truth
- [ ] Calculate accuracy metrics
- [ ] Document results

### Deployment (If >70% Accuracy)
- [ ] Export model to GGUF format
- [ ] Integrate with email pipeline
- [ ] Set up inference server
- [ ] Run production tests

## Cleanup Summary

### Storage Optimization
- **Before:** 26GB with 50,581 files
- **After:** ~5GB with organized structure
- **Saved:** 21GB (removed caches, old models, test files)

### Archived Content
- 7 alternative model attempts (Llama, Gemma, Qwen, LFM2)
- 40+ test scripts
- 100+ log files
- 4GB virtual environment
- 7.2GB model cache

### Git Integration
- Updated .gitignore with fine-tuning patterns
- Excluded archived/, model_cache/, logs
- Kept only active training files in version control

## Technical Notes

### Why Phi-2?
- **Size:** 2.7B parameters fits in 54GB RAM
- **Architecture:** Transformer-based, good for text understanding
- **LoRA Compatible:** Efficient fine-tuning with 0.19% trainable params
- **CPU Friendly:** Runs on CPU with reasonable performance

### Training Insights
- First step takes longer due to gradient accumulation (8 batches)
- ~6.5 minutes per step on CPU (multi-core)
- Loss starting at 2.1964 is healthy for language model training
- Memory usage stable at 12-13GB
