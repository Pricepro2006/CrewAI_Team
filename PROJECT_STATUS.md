### üü° Known Issues

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Some checks temporarily disabled to unblock development
   - TypeScript checking relaxed due to refactoring
   - Some tests skipped pending updates
   - Will be re-enabled after test updates

2. **ESM Module Resolution**: Node.js v22 has issues with TypeScript imports
   - Solution: Use `pnpm dev:client` for UI development
   - Alternative: Run production build
   - Fix planned: Consider ts-node-dev or Vite for backend

3. **Test Updates Needed**: After major refactoring
   - Unit tests need updates for new structure
   - Integration tests need mock updates
   - E2E tests need environment setup

### üöÄ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
pnpm approve-builds  # Select all packages

# Development (recommended approach)
pnpm dev:client     # Terminal 1: Frontend only
node --import tsx --experimental-specifier-resolution=node src/api/mock-server-v2.ts  # Terminal 2: Mock API

# Alternative development
pnpm dev:alt        # Uses custom script for better ESM handling

# Production build
pnpm build
pnpm start

# Quality checks
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```
