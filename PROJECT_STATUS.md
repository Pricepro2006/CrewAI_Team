# Project Status - AI Agent Team Framework

## Current State (July 15, 2025)

### ✅ Completed Setup
- All dependencies installed with pnpm
- Ollama installed with required models (qwen3:14b, qwen3:8b, nomic-embed-text)
- Database initialized (SQLite)
- Project structure validated
- Documentation updated

### 🟡 Known Issues
1. **ESM Module Resolution**: The server has TypeScript/ESM import issues with Node.js v22
   - Client runs perfectly
   - Server requires workarounds (see TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Option 1: Run client only (for UI development)
pnpm dev:client

# Option 2: Use the alternative dev script
pnpm dev:alt

# Option 3: Build and run production
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### 📁 Key Files Modified/Created
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated with current project state and known issues
2. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
3. **scripts/dev.sh** - Alternative development script that handles ESM issues
4. **tailwind.config.js** - Created for Tailwind CSS
5. **postcss.config.js** - Created for PostCSS
6. **tsconfig.server.json** - Created for server TypeScript configuration
7. **src/core/shared/types.ts** - Created to avoid circular dependencies

### 🔧 Configuration Changes
- Downgraded @tanstack/react-query from v5 to v4.40.1 for tRPC compatibility
- Added multer for file upload support
- Fixed axios ESM import issues
- Created shared types to resolve circular dependencies

### 📊 Test Results
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Client (UI) | ✅ Working | Runs on http://localhost:5173 |
| Ollama | ✅ Working | All models installed |
| Database | ✅ Working | SQLite initialized |
| Server | 🟡 Issues | ESM module resolution problems |
| ChromaDB | ⚠️ Optional | Not running, but not required |

### 🎯 Next Steps
1. Consider migrating to ts-node-dev for better development experience
2. Or use Vite for the backend as well (unified tooling)
3. Set up ChromaDB if RAG features are needed
4. Start implementing actual agent logic

### 💡 Recommendations
1. **For Development**: Use `pnpm dev:client` and mock API responses
2. **For Testing Full Stack**: Use `pnpm build && pnpm start`
3. **For Production**: Deploy with Docker using the provided Dockerfile

- **README.md** - User-facing documentation
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions
- **docs/Claude.md** - Detailed implementation guide

### 🔑 Important Notes
- This is a React + Vite project, NOT Next.js
- Uses pnpm, not npm or yarn
- Requires Node.js 18+ (tested with v22.15.0)
- ChromaDB is optional - system works without it
- All Ollama models must be qwen3 versions, not qwen2.5
