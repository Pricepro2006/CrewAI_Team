  - Session management
  - Protected routes and procedures
- **Error Recovery Mechanisms**: Enhanced resilience
  - Automatic retry strategies
  - Circuit breaker patterns

### 🟡 Known Issues

1. **Integration Tests**: Currently updating to use real Ollama
   - Tests must not use mocks per project guardrails
   - Must fail gracefully when Ollama unavailable
   - Using qwen2.5:0.5b model for faster test execution
   - Some tests may timeout with real LLM calls

2. **ESM Module Resolution**: Node.js v22 has issues with TypeScript imports
   - Solution: Use `pnpm dev:client` for UI development
   - Alternative: Run production build
   - Fix planned: Consider ts-node-dev or Vite for backend

3. **Remaining TypeScript Issues**:
   - Legacy files need updates (index.ts, memory-integration.ts)
   - Some test files have outdated interfaces
   - Non-critical for production operation

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
pnpm approve-builds  # Select all packages

# Development (recommended approach)
pnpm dev:client     # Terminal 1: Frontend only
node --import tsx --experimental-specifier-resolution=node src/api/mock-server-v2.ts  # Terminal 2: Mock API

# Alternative development
pnpm dev:alt        # Uses custom script for better ESM handling

# Production build
pnpm build
pnpm start

# Quality checks
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```
