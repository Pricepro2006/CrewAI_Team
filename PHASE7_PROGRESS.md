## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

```typescript
interface ConfidenceRAGSystem {
  // Step 1: Query Processing
  queryProcessor: QueryComplexityAnalyzer;
  ragRetriever: ConfidenceRAGRetriever;
  
  // Step 2: Response Generation
  responseGenerator: ConfidenceResponseGenerator;
  logProbExtractor: TokenConfidenceExtractor;
  
  // Step 3: Evaluation
  multiModalEvaluator: ResponseEvaluator;
  confidenceCalibrator: CalibrationEngine;
  
  // Step 4: Delivery
  adaptiveDelivery: ResponseDeliveryManager;
  feedbackLoop: ContinuousLearningSystem;
}
```

### Confidence Thresholds

```typescript
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  retrieval: { minimum: 0.6, preferred: 0.75 },
  generation: { acceptable: 0.7, review: 0.4 },
  overall: { high: 0.8, medium: 0.6, low: 0.4 }
};
```
