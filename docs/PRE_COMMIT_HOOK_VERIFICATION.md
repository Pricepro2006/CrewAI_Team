# Pre-commit Hook Verification Report

## Date: January 30, 2025

## Summary

Pre-commit hooks are partially working but have several issues that need attention.

## Current Hook Configuration

### Pre-commit Hook (`.husky/pre-commit`)

- **Status**: Working with issues
- **Components**:
  1. Lint-staged execution
  2. Security validations
  3. Test execution for changed files
  4. TypeScript type checking

### Commit-msg Hook (`.husky/commit-msg`)

- **Status**: Working after fix
- **Issue**: Had merge conflict that was resolved
- **Function**: Validates commit message format using conventional commits

### Lint-staged Configuration (`.lintstagedrc.json`)

- **ESLint**: Applied with `--fix` flag
- **Prettier**: Applied with `--write` flag
- **Security checks**: Multiple custom scripts
- **File size checks**: Custom validation

## Issues Found

### 1. Husky Deprecation Warning

```
husky - DEPRECATED
Please remove the following two lines from .husky/pre-commit:
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"
They WILL FAIL in v10.0.0
```

**Impact**: Warning only, but will break in future Husky versions

### 2. TypeScript Errors Not Blocking Commits

- **Problem**: The pre-commit hook runs `tsc --noEmit` but there are 106 TypeScript errors in the codebase
- **Expected**: TypeScript errors should block commits
- **Actual**: TypeScript check runs AFTER lint-staged completes, so file modifications by ESLint/Prettier may bypass the check
- **Root Cause**: Order of operations issue - TypeScript check runs on staged files after they've been modified by linters
- **Evidence**: TypeScript correctly returns exit code 2 when run manually, but the check occurs after lint-staged has already modified files

### 3. Test Runner Hanging

- **Problem**: When TypeScript files are staged, the test runner hangs waiting for input
- **Command**: `npm run test:related`
- **Behavior**: Vitest runs but finds no related test files and waits indefinitely
- **Impact**: Pre-commit hook times out after 60 seconds

### 4. File Modifications by Hooks

- **Prettier**: Successfully formats files
- **ESLint**: Successfully fixes linting issues
- **Impact**: Files are modified during commit, which can cause issues if not handled properly

## Test Results

### Test 1: Markdown File Commit

- **File**: README.md
- **Result**: ✅ Success
- **Hooks Applied**: Prettier formatting, security checks
- **Time**: ~5 seconds

### Test 2: TypeScript File Commit

- **File**: src/api/middleware/asyncHandler.ts
- **Result**: ⚠️ Timed out due to hanging test runner
- **Hooks Applied**: ESLint, Prettier, security checks
- **Time**: 60+ seconds (timeout)

### Test 3: Commit with --no-verify

- **Result**: ✅ Success (bypasses all hooks)
- **Time**: Instant

### Test 4: Direct Tool Execution

- **ESLint**: ✅ No errors on tested file
- **Prettier**: ✅ File already formatted
- **TypeScript**: ❌ 106 errors in codebase (not blocking commits)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Husky Deprecation**
   - Remove deprecated lines from hook files
   - Update to latest Husky configuration format

2. **Fix Test Runner Hanging**
   - Either remove test execution from pre-commit
   - Or configure it to skip when no tests are found
   - Add proper timeout handling

3. **Fix TypeScript Check**
   - Ensure TypeScript errors actually block commits
   - Consider running TypeScript check only on staged files
   - Add proper error handling to ensure exit code is propagated

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Address TypeScript Errors**
   - 106 TypeScript errors need to be fixed
   - Most are in Walmart components and client-side code
   - Should be addressed before production deployment

2. **Optimize Hook Performance**
   - Consider running only on staged files
   - Add caching for unchanged files
   - Parallelize independent checks

### Configuration Updates

1. **Update package.json Scripts**

   ```json
   "test:related": "vitest related --run --passWithNoTests",
   "typecheck:staged": "tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck"
   ```

2. **Update Pre-commit Hook**
   - Add proper error handling
   - Ensure all checks properly propagate exit codes
   - Add timeouts for long-running processes

## Key Discovery: File Modifications During Commit

The most significant issue discovered is that **pre-commit hooks are modifying files during the commit process**. This creates several problems:

1. **TypeScript Errors Masked**: When ESLint and Prettier modify files, the subsequent TypeScript check may not catch all errors
2. **Potential for New Errors**: Automated fixes could introduce new TypeScript errors that aren't caught
3. **Inconsistent State**: The committed code may differ from what the developer tested locally

This is a known issue with lint-staged when using `--fix` flags with ESLint and `--write` with Prettier.

## Conclusion

The pre-commit hooks are functional but have critical issues:

- ✅ Prettier and ESLint are working correctly (but modify files)
- ✅ Security checks are running
- ❌ TypeScript errors are not reliably blocking commits due to file modifications
- ❌ Test runner causes timeouts
- ⚠️ Husky deprecation warnings need addressing
- ⚠️ File modifications during commit can introduce inconsistencies

**Recommendation**: Consider running checks WITHOUT automatic fixes in pre-commit hooks, or ensure TypeScript validation happens BEFORE any file modifications.
