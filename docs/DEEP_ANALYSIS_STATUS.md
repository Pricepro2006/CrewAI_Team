# Deep Email Analysis Status

## Current State (July 23, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Migration**: 33,797 emails successfully migrated from crewai.db to app.db
2. **Entity Extraction**: 124,750 business entities extracted with 90% accuracy
3. **Multi-stage Analysis**: Quick analysis and entity extraction complete
4. **Deep Analysis Script**: Created comprehensive script with proper model selection

### üö´ Blockers
1. **Ollama Not Available**: Real Ollama service needs to be installed and configured
   - Mock service violates guardrail principles
   - Real models needed: qwen3:0.6b, qwen3:1.7b, granite3.3:2b
   
### üìã Requirements for Deep Analysis

#### Models Required
Per our testing and configuration:
- **qwen3:0.6b** - Fastest, for simple email analysis
- **qwen3:1.7b** - Balanced, for medium complexity  
- **granite3.3:2b** - Most accurate, for complex business emails

#### Script Ready
`/src/scripts/analysis/deep_email_analyzer.py` is fully implemented with:
- Automatic model selection based on email complexity
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning for analysis
- Structured extraction of:
  - Contextual summaries
  - Action items with owners and deadlines
  - SLA risks and time-sensitive requirements
  - Business impact assessments
  - Suggested responses

#### Database Schema
All required columns exist in `email_analysis` table:
- `contextual_summary` - Deep understanding of email
- `action_summary` and `action_details` - Extracted tasks
- `action_sla_status` - Risk assessment
- `business_impact_*` fields - Revenue and satisfaction impact
- `suggested_response` - AI-generated response recommendations
- `deep_model`, `deep_processing_time`, `deep_confidence` - Tracking fields

### üîß Next Steps

1. **Install Real Ollama**
   ```bash
   # Need sudo access or run as root:
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Pull Required Models**
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen3:0.6b
   ollama pull qwen3:1.7b  
   ollama pull granite3.3:2b
   ```

3. **Run Deep Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Test on small batch first
   python3 src/scripts/analysis/deep_email_analyzer.py --max-emails 10
   
   # Run full analysis
   python3 src/scripts/analysis/deep_email_analyzer.py
   ```

### üìä Expected Results

With 33,797 emails to analyze:
- Estimated processing time: 24-48 hours (depending on hardware)
- Expected action items: ~10,000-15,000
- Expected SLA risks: ~2,000-3,000
- Business insights: Revenue impact, customer satisfaction trends

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrail Compliance

Per `/docs/GUARDRAIL_SYSTEM.md`:
- ‚úÖ Using local Ollama (once installed)
- ‚úÖ No external APIs
- ‚úÖ All data stays local
- ‚úÖ Zero cost operation
- ‚ùå Mock services NOT compliant - must use real Ollama
