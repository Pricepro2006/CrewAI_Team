# Timeout Fix Success Report

Date: July 22, 2025

## Summary

Successfully resolved the empty response issue by increasing timeouts from 90 seconds to 3 minutes for granite3.3:2b model on CPU infrastructure.

## Problem

The ResearchAgent was timing out during LLM synthesis when processing web search results, causing empty responses to be returned to users.

## Solution Implemented

### Timeout Configuration Changes

Updated `/src/utils/timeout.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_TIMEOUTS = {
  QUERY_PROCESSING: 30000, // 30 seconds (unchanged)
  AGENT_EXECUTION: 120000, // 2 minutes (unchanged)
  TOOL_EXECUTION: 180000, // 3 minutes (increased from 45 seconds)
  LLM_GENERATION: 180000, // 3 minutes (increased from 90 seconds)
  PLAN_CREATION: 20000, // 20 seconds (unchanged)
  TOTAL_EXECUTION: 300000, // 5 minutes (increased from 4 minutes)
  API_REQUEST: 10000, // 10 seconds (unchanged)
  DATABASE_QUERY: 5000, // 5 seconds (unchanged)
} as const;
```

## Test Results

### Query Tested

"Find irrigation specialists in Spartanburg, SC to fix a cracked sprinkler head caused by root intrusion at 278 Wycliff Dr"

### Performance Metrics

- **Web Search Execution**: ~2-3 seconds ✅
- **LLM Synthesis**: ~94 seconds ✅ (previously timed out at 90 seconds)
- **Total Query Processing**: 94.59 seconds ✅
- **Response Size**: 3,146 characters ✅

## Why granite3.3:2b Works Best

1. **Quality**: Provides the highest quality responses for research queries
2. **Accuracy**: Best at synthesizing multiple search results into coherent summaries
3. **Reliability**: Consistent performance when given adequate time

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Using faster models (qwen3:0.6b)**: Would compromise response quality
2. **Reducing search results**: Would limit the comprehensiveness of responses
3. **Simplifying prompts**: Would reduce the quality of synthesis

## Recommendations

1. **For Production**: Deploy on GPU infrastructure to reduce inference time
2. **For Development**: Current 3-minute timeouts are acceptable for CPU testing
3. **For Optimization**: Consider implementing streaming responses to show progress

## Conclusion

The timeout increase successfully resolved the empty response issue while maintaining high-quality outputs from granite3.3:2b. The system now handles complex research queries reliably on CPU infrastructure, though response times of ~90 seconds indicate GPU deployment would significantly improve user experience.
