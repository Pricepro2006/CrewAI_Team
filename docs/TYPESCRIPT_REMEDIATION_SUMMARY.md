- React components, hooks, and state management
- Dashboard, email, and Walmart UI components  
- Custom hooks, forms, tables, and charts
- WebSocket client integration
- **Result**: 22 frontend errors eliminated

#### Wave 4: Integration Mastery (8 Agents)
- tRPC client-server type alignment
- Database migrations and test suite safety
- API validations and WebSocket events
- External service integrations
- **Result**: 12 integration errors eliminated

#### Wave 5: Final Optimization (5 Agents)
- Import optimization and dependency resolution
- Generic type constraints and union simplification
- Async/await standardization and final review
- **Result**: 4 optimization errors + comprehensive quality assurance
