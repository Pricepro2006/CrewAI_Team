## Issues Resolved During Testing

### 1. ChromaDB Connection Error (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Health check failing with "error" status
**Root Cause**: Wrong port (8001) and API version (v1)  
**Solution**: Updated to port 8000 and v2 API
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

### 2. LLM Timeout Issues (HIGH)

**Problem**: 30-second timeout too short for granite3.3:2b
**Root Cause**: Model needs ~29 seconds, creating race condition
**Solution**: Increased timeouts to 60s LLM, 90s agent, 180s total  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

### 3. SimplePlanGenerator Tool Name Missing (HIGH)

**Problem**: requiresTool: true but no toolName specified
**Root Cause**: Missing selectTool() method
**Solution**: Added tool selection logic for web_search
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Plan Execution Silent Failure (CRITICAL)

**Symptom**: Processing completes in ~100ms with success: false
**Impact**: No LLM responses generated despite perfect infrastructure
**Analysis**:

- All 4 MasterOrchestrator steps work correctly
- Plan generation succeeds
- Execution fails immediately without error logs
- Direct Ollama API works perfectly

**Suspected Causes**:

1. **Tool Registration**: web_search tool not properly registered with ResearchAgent
2. **Agent Initialization**: Agent registry might not have tools loaded
3. **Error Swallowing**: Exceptions being caught and not logged
4. **Plan Executor Logic**: Issue in executeWithTool or executeInformationQuery

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times

- **Query Analysis**: ~2ms (excellent)
- **Agent Routing**: ~1ms (excellent)
- **Plan Creation**: ~1ms (excellent)
- **Total Processing**: ~100ms (too fast - indicates early failure)
- **Direct LLM Call**: 28.8 seconds (working correctly)

### System Load

- **API Server**: Stable on port 3001
- **WebSocket**: Stable on port 3002
- **Client**: Stable on port 5173
- **Memory Usage**: Normal operation levels
- **CPU Usage**: Low during processing (expected for quick failure)
