## Implementation Guide

### Phase 2 Analysis (Llama 3.2:3b)
```typescript
// Business intelligence extraction
const businessContext = await businessContextManager.buildPhase2Context(
  email, phase1Results, chainData
);

const prompt = biPromptBuilder.buildPhase2Prompt(
  businessContext, phase1Results, emailContent, ["financial", "workflow"]
);

const analysis = await optimizedBusinessAnalysisService.processEmailWithBusinessIntelligence(
  email, chainData, historicalData
);
```

### Phase 3 Analysis (Phi-4)
```typescript
// Executive strategic analysis
const threadContext = await threadContextManager.buildThreadContext(
  chain, emails, businessContext
);

const executivePrompt = biPromptBuilder.buildPhase3Prompt(
  businessContext, phase1Results, phase2Results, 
  threadContext.contextSummary, historicalData
);

const strategicAnalysis = await optimizedBusinessAnalysisService.runOptimizedPhase3(
  email, phase1Results, phase2Results, businessContext, threadContext
);
```

### Batch Processing for Scale
```typescript
const batchOptions: BatchProcessingOptions = {
  batchSize: 50,
  maxConcurrency: 10,
  prioritizeHighValue: true,
  useContextOptimization: true,
  performanceTarget: "quality"
};

const results = await optimizedBusinessAnalysisService.processBatch(
  emails, batchOptions
);
```
