## Usage Guidelines

### Processing Large Datasets

```typescript
// Use the memory-safe batch processor
const processor = new MemorySafeBatchProcessor({
  batchSize: 100,
  maxMemoryMB: 500,
});

await processor.processBatch(emails);
```

### Transactional Operations

```typescript
// Wrap operations in transactions
await transactionManager.executeTransaction(async (tx) => {
  // All operations here are atomic
  await saveEmail(tx, email);
  await updateAnalysis(tx, analysis);
});
```

### Retry with Circuit Breaker

```typescript
// Use retry policies for external calls
await retryManager.retry(
  () => callExternalAPI(),
  "api", // Uses API retry policy
);
```

### Checkpointed Operations

```typescript
// Create resumable operations
const operation = checkpointManager.createCheckpointedOperation(
  "import-batch-1",
  "email-import",
);

await operation.process(emails, async (email) => {
  // Automatically checkpointed
});
```
