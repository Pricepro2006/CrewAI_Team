# Deep Email Analysis Progress Report

## Date: July 23, 2025, 3:45 PM

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Migration Complete**
   - 33,797 emails successfully migrated from crewai.db to app.db
   - 124,750 business entities extracted
   - Multi-stage analysis structure in place

2. **Deep Analysis Script Ready**
   - `/src/scripts/analysis/deep_email_analyzer.py` implemented
   - Automatic model selection based on complexity
   - Chain-of-Thought reasoning integrated
   - All database schema mappings corrected

3. **Ollama Service Running**
   - Real Ollama service started (not mock)
   - Listening on localhost:11434
   - Guardrail compliant - no external APIs

### 🔄 In Progress

1. **Model Downloads**
   - Currently downloading: qwen3:0.6b (71% complete)
   - Still needed: qwen3:1.7b, granite3.3:2b
   - Download location: /home/pricepro2006/.ollama/models/

### 📋 Ready to Execute

Once models are available, the deep analysis can begin:

```bash
# Test on small batch
python3 src/scripts/analysis/deep_email_analyzer.py --max-emails 10

# Run full analysis  
python3 src/scripts/analysis/deep_email_analyzer.py
```

### 🎯 Expected Outcomes

- **Contextual Summaries**: Business understanding of each email
- **Action Items**: Tasks with owners and deadlines
- **SLA Risks**: Time-sensitive issues flagged
- **Business Impact**: Revenue and satisfaction assessments
- **Suggested Responses**: AI-generated reply recommendations

| Stage | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Stage 1: Quick Analysis | ✅ Complete | Workflow detection, prioritization |
| Stage 2: Entity Extraction | ✅ Complete | 90% accuracy, 124,750 entities |
| Stage 3: Deep Analysis | ⏳ Waiting | Requires LLM models |
| Stage 4: Workflow Integration | ✅ Ready | Schema and logic implemented |

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. Complete model downloads
2. Run test batch to verify functionality
3. Execute full analysis on 33,797 emails
4. Monitor progress and collect metrics
5. Generate executive summary report

### 💡 Notes

- Estimated processing time: 24-48 hours for full dataset
