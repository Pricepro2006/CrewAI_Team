# Email Management UI Test Report

**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**Test Framework**: Playwright  
**Application**: CrewAI Team (AI Agent Team)

## Executive Summary

The UI test suite was executed to verify that the email management components are properly integrated with the analyzed email data from the three-stage pipeline. The test results show that while the application is running and the Email navigation is functional, there are integration issues preventing the display of analyzed email data in the UI.

## Test Results

### ✅ Passed Tests (6/7)

1. **Navigation to Email Section** - Successfully found and clicked "Email" link
2. **Email Management Section Load** - Page loads without errors
3. **Email List Display** - Component renders (but shows no data)
4. **Email Analysis Details** - Component structure exists
5. **Submenu Components** - Navigation elements present
6. **Test Report Generation** - Successfully generated

### ❌ Failed Tests (1/7)

1. **Main Application Title** - Expected "CrewAI Team" but found "AI Agent Team"

## Key Findings

### 1. **Application Title Mismatch**

- **Issue**: The application title is "AI Agent Team" instead of "CrewAI Team"
- **Impact**: Minor branding inconsistency
- **Recommendation**: Update the title in the application configuration

### 2. **Email Data Not Displayed**

- **Issue**: No email data is visible in the UI despite successful analysis of 33,797 emails
- **Finding**: `Found 0 email elements using selector:`
- **Impact**: Critical - Users cannot see analyzed email data
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Frontend not connected to the correct database
  - API endpoints not returning analyzed data
  - Missing data transformation layer

### 3. **Quality Scores Not Visible**

- **Issue**: `Found 0 quality score displays`
- **Expected**: Should show scores like "7.55/10" for Stage 2 analysis
- **Impact**: Analysis results are not accessible to users

### 4. **Backend Services Running**

- **Positive**:
  - API Server: http://localhost:3001
  - WebSocket: ws://localhost:3002/trpc-ws
  - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- **Issues Noted**:
  - Embedding model not found: `nomic-embed-text`
  - ChromaDB fallback to HTTP mode

## Database Analysis Integration Status

### Pipeline Results (Confirmed Working):

- **Stage 1**: 33,797 emails triaged
- **Stage 2**: 1,000 emails analyzed (avg quality: 7.55/10)
- **Stage 3**: 100 emails deep analyzed (avg quality: 10/10)

### Database Location:

- Analysis data stored in: `data/crewai.db`
- Tables: `emails_enhanced`, `stage_results`, `pipeline_executions`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Verify Database Connection**

   ```typescript
   // Check if frontend is querying the correct database
   // Expected: data/crewai.db
   // Tables: emails_enhanced, stage_results
   ```

2. **Review API Endpoints**
   - Check `/trpc/email.list` endpoint
   - Verify it includes joins to `stage_results` table
   - Ensure analysis fields are returned

3. **Update Frontend Queries**
   - Modify email list query to include analysis data
   - Add quality score display components
   - Include workflow state indicators

### Code Changes Needed:

1. **Email List Query** (likely in `src/server/api/routers/email.ts`):

   ```typescript
   const emails = await db
     .prepare(
       `
     SELECT 
       e.*,
       sr.analysis_quality_score,
       sr.workflow_state,
       sr.business_process,
       sr.summary
     FROM emails_enhanced e
     LEFT JOIN stage_results sr ON e.id = sr.email_id
     WHERE sr.execution_id = (
       SELECT MAX(id) FROM pipeline_executions
     )
     ORDER BY e.received_at DESC
   `,
     )
     .all();
   ```

2. **Frontend Display** (email list component):
   - Add quality score badge
   - Show workflow state
   - Display analysis summary on hover

## Screenshots Captured

- `email-section.png` - Shows email navigation working
- `email-list.png` - Shows empty email list issue

## Conclusion

The email management UI infrastructure is in place and functional, but there's a critical disconnect between the analyzed data in the database and the frontend display. The three-stage pipeline successfully processed and stored analysis for 33,797 emails, but this rich data is not being surfaced in the UI.

**Priority Fix**: Connect the frontend email queries to include the `stage_results` table data to display the analysis insights to users.

## Next Steps

1. Implement database query modifications
2. Update frontend components to display analysis fields
3. Re-run tests to verify data visibility
4. Add specific test cases for analysis data display
