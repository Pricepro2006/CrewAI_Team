- [x] Verify user-aware limits (authenticated vs anonymous)
- [x] Check admin bypass works

### Phase 3: Error Handling Testing ✅

#### 3.1 Frontend Error Boundaries
- [x] Trigger component errors - verify boundaries catch them
- [x] Test error recovery UI
- [x] Verify errors are logged properly
- [x] Check user-friendly error messages

#### 3.2 TypeScript Type Safety
- [x] Run `pnpm typecheck` - should have 0 errors

- [x] Verify no `any` types in critical paths
- [x] Test type inference works correctly

#### 3.3 WebSocket Stability
- [x] Monitor WebSocket connections for 1 hour
- [x] Check memory usage doesn't increase

- [x] Test error tracking captures all errors
- [x] Check performance metrics accuracy

### Phase 4: UI Integration Testing ✅

#### 4.1 Dynamic Data Loading
- [x] **Dashboard** - shows real health data
- [x] **Agents Page** - displays real agent status
- [x] **Chat** - uses real LLM responses

- [x] **Vector Search** - returns real results

#### 4.2 Real-time Updates
- [x] Agent status updates every 5 seconds
- [x] Health dashboard refreshes properly
- [x] WebSocket delivers real-time messages
- [x] Loading states show during updates

#### 4.3 API Integration
- [x] All CRUD operations work
- [x] Error states handled gracefully
