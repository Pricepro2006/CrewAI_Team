```

## Next Steps for Even Better Business Data

While SearXNG gives us better search results, we're still limited by search engine snippets for detailed business information (phone, address, etc.). To get that data, we'd need to either:

1. **Use Google Places API** (within free tier)
2. **Scrape business websites** (with WebScraperTool)
3. **Add specialized business search engines** to SearXNG

But for now, you have unlimited, free, high-quality web searches! 🎊

## Resource Usage

- **CPU**: Minimal (< 5% during searches)
- **RAM**: ~200MB for SearXNG + Redis
- **Disk**: ~100MB for containers + cache
- **Network**: Only when searching

_SearXNG is now your default search provider - enjoy unlimited searches!_
