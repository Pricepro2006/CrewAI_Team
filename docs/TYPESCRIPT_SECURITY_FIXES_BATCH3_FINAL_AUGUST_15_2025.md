## 🛠️ Established Development Patterns

### **TypeScript Best Practices Implemented**
```typescript
// 1. Strict Type Definitions
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  status: 'success' | 'error';
  message?: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

// 2. Proper Import Patterns
import type { EmailRecord } from "../../types/EmailTypes.js";
import { Logger } from "../../utils/logger.js";

// 3. Generic Type Usage  
class Repository<T extends BaseEntity> {
  async findById(id: string): Promise<T | null> {
    // Implementation with type safety
  }
}

// 4. Null Safety Patterns
function processEmail(email: EmailRecord): string {
  return email.subject?.toLowerCase() ?? 'No subject';
}
```

### **Security Implementation Patterns**
```typescript
// 1. Input Validation
const emailSchema = z.object({
  to: z.string().email(),
  subject: z.string().max(200),
  body: z.string().max(10000)
});

// 2. Secure Random Generation
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto';
const secureToken = randomBytes(32).toString('hex');

// 3. SQL Injection Prevention
const result = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?').get(email);

// 4. JWT Security
const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET!, {
  expiresIn: '7d',
  algorithm: 'HS256'
});
```
