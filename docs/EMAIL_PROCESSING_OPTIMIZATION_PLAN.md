# Email Processing Pipeline Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

The current email processing pipeline processes ~15-30 seconds per email, which would take **150+ hours** to process 36,000 emails. This document outlines comprehensive optimizations to reduce processing time by **80-90%** through parallel processing, intelligent batching, and architectural improvements.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Sequential Processing**: Emails are processed one at a time within conversations
2. **Synchronous LLM Calls**: Each Ollama API call blocks execution for 5-20 seconds
3. **No Connection Pooling for LLM**: Each request creates a new HTTP connection
4. **Inefficient Database Operations**: Individual INSERTs instead of batch operations
5. **Memory Leaks**: Phase 1 cache grows unbounded
6. **Type Safety Issues**: Loose typing leads to runtime errors and retries

### Current Performance Metrics

- Phase 1 (Rule-based): ~100ms per email ✅
- Phase 2 (Llama 3.2): ~5-10s per email ❌
- Phase 3 (Phi-4): ~15-20s per email ❌
- Total: ~15-30s per email (10+ minutes per 100 conversations)

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Parallel Processing Architecture

#### A. Worker Pool Pattern

- Implement a worker pool with configurable concurrency
- Use Node.js Worker Threads for CPU-intensive operations
- Separate workers for Phase 2 and Phase 3 analysis

#### B. Queue-Based Processing

- Implement Redis-backed job queues for each phase
- Enable horizontal scaling across multiple machines
- Support graceful shutdown and job recovery

#### C. Batch Processing

- Process emails in batches of 10-20 for LLM calls
- Implement database batch operations
- Use streaming for large result sets

### 2. LLM Optimization

#### A. Connection Pooling

- Implement HTTP Keep-Alive for Ollama connections
- Reuse connections across requests
- Implement connection health checks

#### B. Request Batching

- Batch multiple prompts into single LLM calls
- Implement prompt templates for efficiency
- Use smaller context windows when possible

#### C. Caching Strategy

- Cache Phase 1 results with LRU eviction
- Cache common LLM responses
- Implement semantic similarity caching

### 3. Database Optimizations

#### A. Batch Operations

- Use prepared statements with batch inserts
- Implement transaction batching
- Use write-ahead logging (WAL) mode

#### B. Index Optimization

- Add indexes for conversation_id lookups
- Create composite indexes for common queries
- Analyze query patterns and optimize

#### C. Connection Pool Tuning

- Increase connection pool size for workers
- Implement connection warming
- Add connection retry logic

### 4. Type Safety Improvements

#### A. Strict TypeScript Configuration

- Enable all strict mode flags
- Remove all `any` types
- Implement branded types for IDs

#### B. Runtime Validation

- Use Zod for LLM response validation
- Implement type guards for all external data
- Add comprehensive error boundaries

#### C. Type-Safe Database Layer

- Implement typed query builders
- Use type-safe ORMs or query generators
- Add database schema validation

### 5. Memory Management

#### A. Streaming Processing

- Process large datasets in streams
- Implement backpressure handling
- Use generators for memory-efficient iteration

#### B. Cache Management

- Implement TTL-based cache eviction
- Monitor memory usage and adjust limits
- Use WeakMaps for object caching

#### C. Worker Memory Limits

- Set memory limits per worker
- Implement worker recycling
- Monitor and alert on memory usage

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Target Metrics

- **Phase 1**: 50ms per email (50% improvement)
- **Phase 2**: 500ms per email (90% improvement via batching)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2s per email (85% improvement via batching)
- **Total**: 1.5-2.5s per email (85-90% improvement)

### Scalability

- Process 100 emails/minute with 10 workers
- Scale to 1000 emails/minute with 100 workers
- Support horizontal scaling across machines

### Resource Requirements

- **CPU**: 8-16 cores for optimal parallelism
- **Memory**: 16-32GB for worker pools
- **Storage**: Fast SSD for database operations
- **Network**: Low latency to Ollama service

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. LLM Rate Limiting

- Implement exponential backoff
- Queue overflow handling
- Fallback to rule-based processing

### 2. Memory Exhaustion

- Worker memory limits
- Automatic worker recycling
- Memory usage monitoring

### 3. Data Consistency

- Implement idempotent processing
- Add transaction support
- Implement audit logging

### 4. System Failures

- Job persistence in Redis
- Automatic job retry
- Dead letter queue for failed jobs

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

- Emails processed per minute
- Average processing time per phase
- LLM response times
- Memory usage per worker
- Queue depths and backlogs
- Error rates by type

### Alerting Thresholds

- Processing rate < 50 emails/minute
- Average latency > 5 seconds
- Memory usage > 80%
- Error rate > 5%
- Queue depth > 10,000

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Current State

- 36,000 emails × 20s = 200 hours processing time
- Single-threaded, non-scalable
- High risk of timeouts and failures

### Optimized State

- 36,000 emails × 2s = 20 hours with 1 worker
- 36,000 emails ÷ 10 workers = 2 hours total
- Horizontally scalable
- Fault-tolerant with automatic recovery

### ROI

- 90% reduction in processing time
- 10x improvement in throughput
- Reduced operational costs
- Improved reliability and monitoring

3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Weekly progress reviews
5. Performance testing at each phase
