## Risk Register

1. **Database Performance**: Large email volumes may slow queries
   - Mitigation: Add indexes, implement pagination

2. **API Rate Limits**: Microsoft Graph API has rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implement backoff, batch requests

3. **Memory Usage**: Large batches may consume excessive memory
   - Mitigation: Limit batch sizes, implement streaming

4. **Service Reliability**: Services may crash
   - Mitigation: SystemD restart policies, monitoring alerts
