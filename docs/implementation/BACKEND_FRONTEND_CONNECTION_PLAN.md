# Backend-Frontend Connection Plan

## Current Status

- ✅ Backend services implemented (MasterOrchestrator, RAG, Tools)
- ✅ tRPC routers defined
- ✅ Mock servers replaced with real services
- ✅ Frontend connected to real backend
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates implemented

## Step 1: Remove Mock Servers and Connect Real Backend ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Update Server Configuration ✅

- Real services implemented in src/api/server.ts
- Mock server imports removed
- Production-ready server configuration

### 1.2 Fix Health Check Endpoints ✅

Health checks implemented in src/api/routes/health.router.ts:

- ✅ Ollama connection status
- ✅ ChromaDB connection status (with graceful degradation)
- ✅ Database connection status
- ✅ Comprehensive system health monitoring

### 1.3 Update tRPC Context ✅

All services initialized in src/api/trpc/context.ts:

- ✅ MasterOrchestrator with Ollama integration
- ✅ ConversationService with SQLite
- ✅ AgentRegistry with all specialized agents
- ✅ RAGSystem with ChromaDB (graceful fallback to in-memory)
- ✅ TaskService and MaestroFramework for task management

## Step 2: Frontend API Integration ✅ COMPLETED

### 2.1 Update API Endpoints ✅

Frontend configured with correct backend URL:

- ✅ tRPC client properly configured in App.tsx
- ✅ HTTP batch link connected to http://localhost:3000/trpc
- ✅ CORS properly configured for development

### 2.2 Test Chat Interface ✅

All chat functionality verified:

- ✅ chat.create mutation working with real MasterOrchestrator
- ✅ Conversation history persisted in SQLite
- ✅ Real LLM responses from Ollama models
- ✅ Error handling and graceful degradation

## Step 3: WebSocket Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

### 3.1 Server-Side WebSocket ✅

Implemented in src/api/routes/websocket.router.ts:

- ✅ Agent status updates with performance metrics
- ✅ Real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, active tasks)
- ✅ Progress notifications for long-running tasks
- ✅ Event-driven architecture with graceful error handling

### 3.2 Client-Side WebSocket ✅

WebSocket client integrated:

- ✅ Automatic connection/reconnection handling
- ✅ Subscription management for different event types
- ✅ Real-time UI updates in AgentMonitor component
- ✅ Toast notifications for important events

## Testing Checklist ✅ ALL COMPLETE

- [x] Start backend server without errors
- [x] Frontend connects to backend
- [x] Chat interface sends queries to real orchestrator
- [x] Responses come from Ollama models
- [x] Agent status updates in real-time via WebSocket
- [x] Error handling works properly
- [x] Health check endpoints functional
- [x] WebSocket reconnection handling
- [x] Task management system operational
- [x] RAG system with graceful degradation

## Production Deployment Status

### Completed Features:

- ✅ Full backend implementation with Ollama integration
- ✅ Frontend with professional chat interface
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket updates
- ✅ Comprehensive health monitoring
- ✅ Task management with queue system
- ✅ Data collection pipeline (Bright Data)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ Security middleware and rate limiting

### Remaining Tasks:

- ⏳ User authentication system (JWT prepared, needs implementation)
