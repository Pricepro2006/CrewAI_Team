- **Active Development**: `fix/critical-email-processing-issues`
- **Remote Branches**: 13

### Critical Files to Preserve
1. **Email Processing Scripts**:
   - `scripts/claude_opus_llm_processor.py` (timeout increased to 300s)
   - `scripts/process_emails_parallel_quality.py` (quality gates)
   - `scripts/monitor_high_quality_bi.py` (accurate monitoring)

   - `src/ui/components/UnifiedEmail/BusinessIntelligenceDashboard.css`

3. **Documentation**:
   - All files in `docs/` updated with accurate status

## üöÄ Safe Cleanup Process

### Phase 1: Preserve Current Work
```bash
# 1. Ensure all work is committed (DONE)
git status  # Should show clean

# 2. Push current branch (DONE)
git push origin fix/critical-email-processing-issues

# 3. Create backup tag (DONE)
git tag -a backup/pre-cleanup-20250805-130505

# 4. Push tags to remote (DONE)
git push origin --tags
```

### Phase 2: Safe Branch Cleanup
```bash
# 1. List branches safe to delete (already merged)
git branch --merged main | grep -v "main\|fix/critical-email-processing-issues"

# 2. Delete only after review
git branch -d <branch-name>  # Use -d (safe delete), not -D

# 3. Clean remote tracking
git remote prune origin
```

### Phase 3: Branch Consolidation Plan

#### Branches to Keep:
1. `main` - Production baseline
2. `fix/critical-email-processing-issues` - Current work (788 BI emails)
3. `production/v2.0.0` - Production release

#### Branches to Archive (tag then delete):
1. Backup branches from July 2025
2. Completed feature branches
3. Old fix branches

#### Branches to Consolidate:
1. All walmart-* branches ‚Üí `feature/walmart-consolidated`
2. All integration/* branches ‚Üí Review individually

## üìã Verification Checklist

Before any deletion:
- [ ] All changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Backup tag created and pushed
- [ ] No unique work in branch (check with `git log`)
- [ ] Branch is fully merged to main or another kept branch
- [ ] Team notification sent if needed

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Continue Email Processing**: Let it run while we clean
2. **Monitor Progress**: Check `monitor_high_quality_bi.py`
3. **Gradual Cleanup**: Delete branches in small batches
4. **Update PR #9**: Add accurate metrics

## üõ°Ô∏è Recovery Options

If anything goes wrong:
```bash
# Restore from backup tag
git checkout backup/pre-cleanup-20250805-130505

# Restore deleted branch from reflog
git reflog
git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>

# Pull from remote if needed
git fetch --all
```
