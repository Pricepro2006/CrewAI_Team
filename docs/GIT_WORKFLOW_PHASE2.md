# Git Workflow for Phase 2: High Priority System Reliability

## Overview

This document outlines the Git workflow and best practices for Phase 2 of the CrewAI Team project, focusing on system reliability improvements.

## Branch Structure

### Current Branch

- **Branch Name**: `feature/reliability-phase2`
- **Base Branch**: `main`
- **Purpose**: Implement high-priority system reliability improvements

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/reliability-phase2
├── Sub-features can be created as needed:
│   ├── feature/reliability-phase2-db-optimization
│   ├── feature/reliability-phase2-agent-resilience
│   └── feature/reliability-phase2-monitoring
```

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Starting Work

```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git checkout feature/reliability-phase2

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin feature/reliability-phase2

# Check status
git status
```

### 2. Making Changes

```bash
# Make your changes
# ...

# Stage changes
git add <files>

# Commit with Phase 2 template
git commit
# This will open the commit template
```

### 3. Commit Message Format

The repository is configured with a Phase 2-specific commit template (`.gitmessage-phase2`).

**Format**: `<type>: <description>`

**Types**:

- `reliability`: System reliability improvements
- `performance`: Performance optimizations
- `fix`: Bug fixes related to system stability
- `monitor`: Monitoring and alerting improvements
- `resilience`: Fault tolerance and recovery
- `cache`: Caching and optimization
- `refactor`: Code improvements for reliability
- `test`: Testing for reliability features
- `docs`: Documentation updates

**Examples**:

```
reliability: Add connection pooling to database manager
performance: Implement lazy loading for agent initialization
fix: Resolve SQLite connection timeout issues
monitor: Add performance metrics collection
resilience: Implement exponential backoff for API calls
```

### 4. Pushing Changes

```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin feature/reliability-phase2
```

### 5. Creating Pull Request

When Phase 2 is complete:

1. Push all changes to `feature/reliability-phase2`
2. Create PR from `feature/reliability-phase2` to `main`
3. Use PR template focusing on:
   - Reliability improvements made
   - Performance metrics
   - Testing coverage
   - Breaking changes (if any)

## Phase 2 Focus Areas

### 1. Database Reliability

- Connection pooling
- Transaction management
- Error recovery
- Performance optimization

### 2. Agent System Resilience

- Failure recovery
- Resource management
- Timeout handling
- Circuit breaker patterns

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- Metrics collection
- Performance benchmarks
- Resource usage tracking
- Bottleneck identification

### 4. Error Handling

- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Graceful degradation
- Retry mechanisms
- Error reporting

### 5. System Health

- Health check endpoints
- Service status monitoring
- Dependency checks
- Alerting mechanisms

## Best Practices

### 1. Atomic Commits

- Each commit should represent one logical change
- Include tests with implementation
- Update documentation as needed

### 2. Testing

- Write tests for reliability features
- Include stress tests where applicable
- Test failure scenarios
- Verify recovery mechanisms

### 3. Code Review

- Focus on reliability patterns
- Check for potential failure points
- Verify error handling
- Review performance implications

### 4. Documentation

- Document reliability patterns used
- Include performance considerations
- Update system architecture docs
- Add troubleshooting guides

## Git Commands Reference

### Viewing History

```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline --graph --decorate

# View changes in current branch
git log main..feature/reliability-phase2
```

### Managing Changes

```bash
# Stash changes temporarily
git stash save "WIP: reliability improvements"

# Apply stashed changes
git stash pop

# Cherry-pick specific commits if needed
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Syncing with Main

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge main into feature branch
git checkout feature/reliability-phase2
git merge main
```

## Phase Transition

When transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2:

1. Ensure all Phase 1 changes are committed and pushed
2. Create PR for Phase 1 if not already done
3. Switch to Phase 2 branch: `git checkout feature/reliability-phase2`
4. Update commit template configuration (already done)
5. Begin Phase 2 work
