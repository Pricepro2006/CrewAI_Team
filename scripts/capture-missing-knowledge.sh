# Configuration Learnings from July 17-18, 2025

## Vector Store Issues
- **Problem**: ChromaDB not initializing properly
- **Path Attempted**: ./data/chroma and ./data/chroma-test
- **Status**: Directory doesn't exist, causing "chromadb:error" in health checks
- **Learning**: Need to create vector store directory and properly initialize ChromaDB

## Model Configurations Tested
- phi3:mini - Used for initial testing
- granite3.3:2b - Selected as main model
- qwen2.5:0.5b - Selected for agents

## RAG Configuration
```json
{
  "vectorStore": {
    "type": "chromadb",
    "path": "./data/chroma",
    "collectionName": "crewai-knowledge",
    "dimension": 384
  },
  "chunking": {
    "size": 500,
    "overlap": 50,
    "method": "sentence"
  },
  "retrieval": {
    "topK": 5,
    "minScore": 0.5,
    "reranking": true
  }
}
```

## Issues Encountered
1. Vector store not initialized
2. Agent routing failures due to missing vector store
3. Replanning loops due to unmet dependencies
4. Health check showing degraded status due to ChromaDB errors

## System Development Progress

### 1. Confidence-Scored RAG System
- Implemented 4-step confidence system (replacing 6-step)
- Created comprehensive confidence scoring components
- Built multi-modal evaluation system
- Developed adaptive delivery manager

### 2. Model Selection and Testing
- Tested multiple models: phi3:mini, granite3.3:2b, qwen2.5:0.5b
- Selected granite3.3:2b as main model
- Selected qwen2.5:0.5b for agent tasks
- Identified performance characteristics

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows
- Implemented security testing (auth, input validation, CSRF)
- Added load testing with k6
- Built memory leak detection system
- Set up automated dependency updates

### 4. Critical Issues Resolved
- Fixed ESLint configuration for TypeScript
- Resolved CodeRabbit YAML parsing errors
- Fixed PR title convention issues
- Addressed workflow file corruption

### 5. System Architecture Insights
- MasterOrchestrator vs ConfidenceMasterOrchestrator distinction
- Vector store initialization requirements
- Agent routing dependencies on vector store
- Health check system monitoring

## Data Not Captured Due to System Issues

### Vector Store Problem
The system was configured to use ChromaDB for vector storage but the directory was never created, causing:
- No vector embeddings stored
- No document chunks saved
- No semantic search capability
- Agent failures when trying to access knowledge base

### Missing Data Types
1. **Web Scraping Results** - No scraping was performed
2. **Vector Embeddings** - ChromaDB not initialized
3. **Document Chunks** - No documents processed
4. **Knowledge Graph** - Not implemented
5. **Learning Feedback** - No feedback loop active

## Recommendations

1. **Initialize Vector Store**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/pricepro2006/CrewAI_Team/data/chroma
   # Initialize ChromaDB collection
   ```

2. **Implement Knowledge Capture Pipeline**
   - Add document ingestion endpoint
   - Create web scraping integration
   - Build feedback capture system

3. **Set Up Knowledge Sync**
   - Automated sync to master_knowledge_base
   - Version control for knowledge updates
   - Metadata tracking for all captures

4. **Enable Learning Loop**
   - Capture successful query resolutions
   - Store error patterns and fixes
   - Build pattern recognition system
