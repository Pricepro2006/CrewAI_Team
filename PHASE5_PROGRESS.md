## Test Coverage Report

### Current Status

```
Core:          45% (needs improvement)
Services:      60% (good progress)
API:           30% (needs work)
Frontend:      25% (needs significant work)
Integration:   10% (just started)
E2E:           5%  (basic setup only)
```

### Target Coverage

- Unit Tests: 80%
- Integration Tests: 70%
- E2E Tests: Key user flows

## Testing Infrastructure

### Tools in Use

- Vitest for unit tests âœ…
- Playwright for E2E âœ…
- React Testing Library (planned)
- k6 for load testing (planned)
- Jest for coverage reports âœ…

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [x] GitHub Actions configured
- [x] Automated testing on PR
- [ ] Automated deployment
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Security scanning

## Identified Issues

### Critical

1. TypeScript errors blocking test runs
2. Test utilities have type mismatches
3. Mock implementations outdated

### High Priority

1. Missing WebSocket tests
2. No load testing infrastructure
3. Limited error scenario coverage

### Medium Priority

1. Incomplete API documentation
2. Missing performance benchmarks
3. No automated security scanning

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

- Test in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on business logic
- Achieve high coverage

### Integration Testing

- Test service interactions
- Verify data flow
- Test error propagation
- Validate contracts

### E2E Testing

- Test critical user journeys
- Verify UI responsiveness
- Test error recovery
- Validate accessibility

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing unit tests (current priority)
2. Implement missing service tests
3. Add comprehensive API tests
4. Set up load testing infrastructure
5. Complete E2E test scenarios
6. Begin Phase 6 (Production Features)

## Quality Metrics

- Bug Density: 2.3 per KLOC
- Test Execution Time: ~3 minutes
- Failed Tests: 15 (being fixed)
- Code Coverage Trend: â†‘ Improving

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: TypeScript errors preventing test execution
- **Medium Risk**: Limited integration test coverage
- **Low Risk**: Performance testing not yet implemented

## Notes

- Testing infrastructure established
- Critical issues being addressed
- Need to prioritize test fixes
- CI/CD pipeline functional but needs enhancement
