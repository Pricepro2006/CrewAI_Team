## Issues Identified for Future Improvement

1. **Part Number Over-Extraction**: Pattern is too aggressive, extracting common words
   - Current: Extracts words like "OFFICE", "SECURITY", "WELCOME"
   - Need: Minimum length and better pattern matching

2. **Empty PO Numbers**: Some extraction returning descriptive text instead of numbers
   - Need: Better validation of extracted entities

## Ready for Next Phase: Deep LLM Analysis

The system is now ready for deep LLM-powered analysis phase with:
- 33,797 emails fully migrated
- 124,750 entities extracted
- Multi-stage analysis infrastructure in place
- All backend services operational

### Next Steps

1. Configure local LLM (granite3.3:2b, qwen3:1.7b, or qwen3:0.6b)
2. Implement deep analysis pipeline
3. Generate contextual summaries
4. Extract action items and SLAs
5. Create business impact assessments
