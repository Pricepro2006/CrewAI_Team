- **Local database search** for known products  
- **External search** via web scraping for discovering new products
- **Personalized recommendations** based on user preferences and purchase history

### 3. tRPC Router (`/src/api/trpc/walmart-grocery.router.ts`)

**New Endpoints:**
- `hybridSearch` - Main hybrid search endpoint
- `quickSearch` - Autocomplete suggestions
- `searchProducts` - Original search (maintained for compatibility)

---

## How It Works

### Search Flow:
1. **User enters search query** (e.g., "milk")
2. **System executes in parallel:**
   - Searches order history for past milk purchases
   - Queries local database for milk products
   - (Optional) Scrapes web for new milk products
   - Generates recommendations (cereal, cookies, etc.)
3. **Results are merged and deduplicated**
4. **UI displays results in categorized sections**

### Intelligence Features:
- **Purchase Frequency Tracking** - Shows how often items were bought
- **Smart Recommendations** - Suggests complementary products
- **Price History** - Tracks price changes over time
- **User Preferences** - Respects dietary restrictions and brand preferences

---

## Database Integration

### Tables Used:
- `walmart_products` - 161 products with full details
- `orders` - User purchase history
- `order_items` - Individual items in orders
- `user_preferences` - Dietary and brand preferences
- `substitutions` - Product alternatives
- `grocery_lists` - Saved shopping lists

---

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Experience** - Shows familiar products first
2. **Discovery** - Helps users find new products
3. **Time Saving** - Quick access to frequently purchased items
4. **Smart Shopping** - AI-powered recommendations
5. **Price Awareness** - Track savings on past purchases
6. **Comprehensive Results** - Combines multiple data sources

   - Recommended (purple highlight)

### Features:
- **Autocomplete** - Start typing for suggestions
- **Filters** - Refine by category, price, availability

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation if external search fails
- Fallback to local data if web scraping unavailable
- Empty state messages for each section
- Comprehensive error logging

## Testing

To test the hybrid search:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:5173/walmart

# Click "Smart Search" tab

# Try searches like:
- "milk" - Should show past purchases + new options
- "bread" - Should recommend butter, jam
- "chicken" - Should suggest rice, vegetables
```

- Discover new products not in their purchase history  
- Get intelligent recommendations
- Use advanced filtering and sorting

This implementation enhances the Walmart Grocery Agent with enterprise-grade search capabilities that balance personalization with discovery.
