# Phase 5G: Security Utilities TypeScript Fixes

## Files Fixed
1. `/src/utils/security/file-upload-scanner.ts`
2. `/src/utils/security/path-validation.ts`

## Issues Resolved

### file-upload-scanner.ts
1. **Line 280: Buffer/Uint8Array Type Conversion**
   - Fixed: `Buffer.concat()` now properly handles chunk types
   - Added type guard: `Buffer.isBuffer(chunk) ? chunk : Buffer.from(chunk)`

2. **Line 411: Object Possibly Undefined**
   - Fixed: Added null check for `match.split()` result
   - Ensured `parts[1]` exists before using

3. **Line 431: Undefined Argument**
   - Fixed: Added null check for regex match result
   - Returns 0 if match or capture group is undefined

### path-validation.ts
1. **Line 137: Undefined Array Access**
   - Fixed: Added null check for basename extraction
   - Ensures basename exists before checking reserved names

2. **Line 263: Undefined Cache Key**
   - Fixed: Added undefined check before deleting cache entry
   - Prevents deletion of undefined keys

3. **Lines 294, 297, 307, 323: Sanitized Property Undefined**
   - Fixed: Added explicit checks for `validation.sanitized`
   - Returns appropriate defaults when sanitized path is undefined
   - Removed forced non-null assertions (!)

## Security Improvements
- Maintained all security validation logic
- Added proper type safety without compromising security
- Improved error handling for edge cases
- No security features were weakened in the process

## TypeScript Error Reduction
- Eliminated all TypeScript errors from security utilities
- Total errors reduced from previous count
- Security utilities now fully type-safe

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test file upload with various file types
2. Verify path traversal protection still works
3. Test with malformed/encoded paths
4. Ensure virus scanning (if ClamAV available) still functions
5. Verify quarantine functionality

## Next Steps
- Continue Phase 5 TypeScript remediation with other modules
- Maintain security posture while fixing type issues
- Document any security-critical changes
