## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add hybrid analysis support
ALTER TABLE email_analysis ADD COLUMN analysis_approach TEXT DEFAULT 'iteration';
ALTER TABLE email_analysis ADD COLUMN priority_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE email_analysis ADD COLUMN enhanced_analysis_needed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### Priority Selection Algorithm
```python
def should_enhance_with_llm(email_analysis):
    return (
        email_analysis.urgency_indicators.includes('HIGH_PRIORITY') or
        email_analysis.workflow_state == 'WAITING' or
        email_analysis.entity_summary.total_entities > 3 or
        email_analysis.business_process in ['Deal Registration', 'Issue Resolution']
    )
```
