# CrewAI Team Performance Analysis & Solutions Summary

**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**System**: AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840HS (8c/16t), 54GB RAM, Radeon 780M Graphics  
**Current Issues**: Slow LLM responses, incorrect agent routing, UI problems

## üîç Analysis Summary

### Current Problems Identified

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Using small models (granite3.3:2b, qwen3:0.6b) causing slow responses
   - Response times: 26s for complex queries, 10s for simple
   - No GPU acceleration configured
   - No caching implemented

2. **Functional Issues** (from UI test report)
   - All queries incorrectly routed to WriterAgent
   - WriterAgent exposing internal thinking process
   - Rate limiting causing UI errors
   - No confidence scores displayed

3. **Underutilized Resources**
   - You have 54GB RAM but using tiny models
   - You have better models installed (qwen3:8b, qwen3:14b) but not using them
   - AMD GPU not being utilized

## üí° Solutions Provided

### 1. **Immediate Improvements** (Can do RIGHT NOW)

- Switch to better models you already have:
  - `qwen3:8b` instead of `granite3.3:2b` for complex queries
  - `qwen3:1.7b` instead of `qwen3:0.6b` for simple queries
- Configure Ollama environment variables for optimization
- Fix agent routing logic

**Expected improvement**: 2-3x faster responses with better quality

### 2. **Short-term Optimizations** (1-2 days)

- Implement simple caching layer
- Add request batching
- Configure llama.cpp with Vulkan for GPU acceleration
- Use quantized versions of larger models (7B Q4_K_M)

**Expected improvement**: 3-5x faster with GPU acceleration

### 3. **Long-term Architecture** (1-2 weeks)

- Hybrid local-remote setup for non-sensitive data
- Advanced caching with semantic similarity
- Model fine-tuning for your specific use cases
- Implement proper 4-step RAG with confidence scoring

**Expected improvement**: Near-instant responses for cached queries, 5-10x overall improvement

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Current Setup       | Immediate Fix     | With Optimizations |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| granite3.3:2b (26s) | qwen3:8b (12-15s) | 7B Q4 + GPU (5-8s) |
| qwen3:0.6b (10s)    | qwen3:1.7b (3-5s) | Cached (<100ms)    |
| No caching          | Simple cache      | Semantic cache     |
| CPU only            | CPU only          | GPU accelerated    |

## üîê Security Maintained

All solutions maintain your security requirements:

- **Local-only processing** for sensitive data
- **Encrypted connections** for any remote endpoints
- **Data classification** before routing
- **Audit trails** for all processing

## üöÄ Action Steps

### Do Today:

1. Update `src/config/model-selection.config.ts` to use better models
2. Set Ollama environment variables
3. Fix agent routing in `AgentRouter.ts`
4. Test with the provided performance script

### Do This Week:

1. Install llama.cpp with AMD GPU support
2. Implement caching layer
3. Download and test larger quantized models
4. Fix UI issues (rate limiting, confidence display)

### Do This Month:

1. Design hybrid architecture for non-sensitive queries
2. Implement advanced caching with embeddings
3. Fine-tune models on your specific data
4. Complete 4-step RAG implementation

## üìÅ Files Created

1. **LOCAL_LLM_PERFORMANCE_SOLUTIONS.md** - Comprehensive technical solutions
2. **IMMEDIATE_PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Quick wins you can do now
3. **test-model-performance.ts** - Script to benchmark improvements

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

With these optimizations:

- **3-5x faster responses** while maintaining local security
- **Better quality** outputs from larger models
- **Reduced costs** through caching and optimization
- **Improved user experience** with fixed routing and UI

## üí¨ Key Takeaway

You don't need cloud LLMs for good performance. Your AMD Ryzen 7 with 54GB RAM is more than capable of running larger, better models locally. The key is using:

1. Properly sized models (4B-8B instead of 0.6B-2B)
2. Quantization (Q4_K_M format)
3. GPU acceleration (Vulkan/ROCm)
4. Smart caching and batching

Start with the immediate improvements - you'll see results in minutes!
