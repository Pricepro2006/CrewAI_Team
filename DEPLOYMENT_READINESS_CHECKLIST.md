## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### Mandatory Requirements (All Must Pass)
```javascript
const goNoGoCriteria = {
  security: {
    requirement: 'No critical/high vulnerabilities',
    current: 'FAIL - Multiple critical issues',
    action: 'Fix all security vulnerabilities'
  },
  authentication: {
    requirement: 'User auth system implemented',
    current: 'FAIL - Not implemented',
    action: 'Implement authentication'
  },
  testing: {
    requirement: '80% test coverage',
    current: 'FAIL - 60% coverage',
    action: 'Write additional tests'
  },
  performance: {
    requirement: '<100ms response time',
    current: 'PASS - 45ms average',
    action: 'Maintain performance'
  },
  stability: {
    requirement: '99.9% uptime',
    current: 'UNKNOWN - Not measured',
    action: '7-day stability test required'
  }
};
```

### Risk Assessment
| Risk Level | Description | Mitigation Required |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| üî¥ **CRITICAL** | Security vulnerabilities | Immediate fix required |
| üî¥ **CRITICAL** | No authentication | Must implement before deploy |
| üü° **HIGH** | Insufficient testing | Increase coverage to 80% |
| üü° **HIGH** | No production infrastructure | Setup and validate |
| üü¢ **MEDIUM** | Documentation gaps | Complete before handover |
| üü¢ **LOW** | Performance optimization | Monitor and optimize |

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** The CrewAI Team platform is **NOT READY** for production deployment.

**Critical Blockers:**
1. Security vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
2. Missing authentication system (CRITICAL)
3. Insufficient test coverage (HIGH)
4. No production infrastructure (HIGH)

**Recommended Action:** Focus on security hardening and authentication implementation as the immediate priority. No deployment should be attempted until all critical security issues are resolved and authentication is implemented.

**Estimated Timeline:** With focused effort, the system could be production-ready in **10-15 business days**.
