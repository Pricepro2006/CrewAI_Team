## Technical Implementation

### app.db Architecture
```sql
emails (base data) → email_analysis (rich analysis)
                  ↓
    - Quick analysis (immediate classification)
    - Deep analysis (comprehensive understanding)
    - Entity extraction (business objects)
    - Workflow mapping (process tracking)
```

### crewai.db Architecture
```sql
emails_enhanced (all data in one table)
    - Basic categorization
