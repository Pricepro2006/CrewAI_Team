# Email Batch Processing Final Report

## Processing Summary

- **Total Email Batches Processed**: 3,380
- **Total Emails Processed**: 33,797
- **Processing Errors**: 0
- **Skipped Emails**: 0
- **Duplicate Detection**: All emails successfully deduplicated

## Email Extraction Quality (Based on 6 Iterations)

- **Initial Accuracy**: ~60%
- **Final Accuracy**: ~90%

### Key Improvements Implemented:

1. **Workflow State Detection** (NEW, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETION)
2. **Business Process Categorization** (Quote Processing, Order Management, Deal Registration, etc.)
3. **Company Extraction** with dynamic patterns and corporate suffix recognition
4. **Vendor Detection** with context awareness and HTML filtering
5. **Reference Number Extraction** (PO#, BD#, REG#, CAS-, FTQ-, Q-, etc.)
6. **SKU Pattern Recognition** including PN# formats
7. **Urgency Indicator Detection** (expedite, critical, in a bind, etc.)
