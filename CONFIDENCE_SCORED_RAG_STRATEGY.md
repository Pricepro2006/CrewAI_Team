## The 4-Step Confidence-Scored RAG Strategy

### Step 1: Intelligent Query Processing & RAG Retrieval

**Objective:** Smart query analysis with confidence-scored document retrieval

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface QueryProcessingResult {
  processedQuery: string;
  queryComplexity: number; // 1-10 scale
  expectedDomains: string[];
  retrievalConfidence: number; // 0-1 score
  documents: ScoredDocument[];
}

interface ScoredDocument {
  content: string;
  retrievalScore: number; // Semantic similarity
  confidenceScore: number; // Document reliability
  source: string;
  metadata: DocumentMetadata;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Query Complexity Assessment:** Automatically classify queries (1-10 complexity)
- **Multi-stage Retrieval:** Initial broad search → confidence filtering → semantic re-ranking
- **Document Confidence Scoring:** Using BERT-based rankers for semantic alignment
- **Retrieval Threshold Management:** Filter out documents below confidence threshold (60-70%)

**Research-Based Enhancements:**
- Implement "contextual re-ranking" from 2025 RAG research
- Use retrieval confidence scoring to reduce irrelevant results by 20%
- Apply conditional conformal factuality for statistical guarantees

### Step 2: Response Generation with Internal Confidence Tracking

**Objective:** Generate responses while tracking model confidence at token level

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ResponseGenerationResult {
  response: string;
  tokenLevelConfidence: TokenConfidence[];
  aggregatedConfidence: number;
  uncertaintyMarkers: string[];
  generationMetrics: GenerationMetrics;
}

interface TokenConfidence {
  token: string;
  logProbability: number;
  confidence: number; // Normalized 0-1
  position: number;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Log Probability Extraction:** Extract token-level probabilities during generation
- **Confidence Aggregation:** Convert log probabilities to normalized confidence scores
- **Uncertainty Detection:** Identify low-confidence segments in response
- **Response Quality Metrics:** Track coherence, factuality, and relevance indicators

**Research-Based Enhancements:**
- Use self-supervised confidence calibration methods from 2025 research
- Implement temperature scaling for overconfidence adjustment
- Apply "Yes/No" confidence assessment for response validation

### Step 3: Multi-Modal Response Evaluation & Calibration

**Objective:** Comprehensive response quality assessment with calibrated confidence scores

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ResponseEvaluationResult {
  overallConfidence: number; // Calibrated final score
  qualityMetrics: QualityMetrics;
  factualityScore: number;
  relevanceScore: number;
  coherenceScore: number;
  recommendedAction: ActionType;
  humanReviewNeeded: boolean;
}

enum ActionType {
  ACCEPT = "accept",           // High confidence (80%+)
  REVIEW = "human_review",     // Medium confidence (40-80%)
  REGENERATE = "regenerate",   // Low confidence (<40%)
  FALLBACK = "fallback_mode"   // System fallback
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-metric Evaluation:** Assess factuality, relevance, coherence separately
- **Confidence Calibration:** Apply isotonic regression or temperature scaling
- **LLM-as-Judge Integration:** Use secondary LLM for quality assessment
- **Statistical Guarantees:** Implement conformal prediction for reliability bounds

**Research-Based Enhancements:**
- Implement Conformal-RAG framework for statistical guarantees
- Use multi-calibration for interpretable confidence scores
- Apply CISC (Confidence-Improved Self-Consistency) for better accuracy

### Step 4: Adaptive Response Delivery & Confidence Feedback Loop

**Objective:** Deliver responses with appropriate confidence indicators and continuous learning

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ResponseDeliveryResult {
  finalResponse: string;
  confidenceIndicator: ConfidenceLevel;
  evidenceSources: Source[];
  uncertaintyAreas: string[];
  improvementSuggestions: string[];
  feedbackLoop: FeedbackData;
}

enum ConfidenceLevel {
  HIGH = "high",         // 80-100% - Present as definitive
  MEDIUM = "medium",     // 60-80% - Present with caveats
  LOW = "low",          // 40-60% - Present as uncertain
  VERY_LOW = "very_low" // <40% - Recommend human consultation
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Confidence-Based Response Formatting:** Adjust presentation based on confidence level
- **Source Attribution:** Provide evidence links with confidence scores
- **Uncertainty Communication:** Clearly indicate areas of low confidence
- **Feedback Integration:** Collect user feedback for confidence calibration improvement
- **Continuous Learning:** Update confidence models based on outcomes

**Research-Based Enhancements:**
- Implement verbalized confidence triggers for self-verification
- Use structured reasoning with distance-based confidence assessment
- Apply human-in-the-loop patterns for confidence boundary cases

## Confidence Threshold Management Strategy

### Dynamic Threshold System

Based on 2025 research findings:

```typescript
interface ConfidenceThresholds {
  retrieval: {
    minimum: 0.6,        // Filter documents below 60%
    preferred: 0.75      // Prioritize documents above 75%
  },
  generation: {
    acceptable: 0.7,     // Accept responses above 70%
    review: 0.4,         // Human review 40-70%
    reject: 0.4          // Regenerate below 40%
  },
  overall: {
    high: 0.8,          // High confidence delivery
    medium: 0.6,        // Medium confidence with caveats
    low: 0.4            // Low confidence with warnings
  }
}
```

### Adaptive Threshold Adjustment

- **Performance Monitoring:** Track accuracy vs confidence correlations
- **Domain-Specific Tuning:** Adjust thresholds per knowledge domain
- **User Feedback Integration:** Refine thresholds based on user satisfaction
- **A/B Testing:** Continuously optimize threshold values

    const generationResult = await this.responseGenerator.generate(
      query, 
      retrievalResult.documents
    );
    
    // Step 3: Multi-modal evaluation and calibration
    const evaluationResult = await this.evaluator.evaluate(
      query, 
      generationResult, 
      retrievalResult
    );
