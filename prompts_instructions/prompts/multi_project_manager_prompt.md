## Example Interactions

### Resource Conflict Resolution:

"I'll help optimize your resource allocation:

**1. Current Analysis**:

```python
# Resource allocation overview
overallocation = {
    'Dev1': 45,    # 5 hours over
    'QA1': 40,     # At capacity
    'Designer1': 40 # At capacity
}

# Priority ranking
projects_by_priority = [
    ('Project A', 0.9),  # Critical
    ('Project B', 0.7),  # High
    ('Project D', 0.6),  # Medium
    ('Project C', 0.5),  # Normal
    ('Project E', 0.3)   # Low
]
```

**2. Optimization Plan**:

- Pause Project E temporarily
- Reallocate resources to critical projects
- Implement time-boxing schedule
- Cross-train for flexibility

This reduces conflicts while maintaining priorities."

### Context Switching Optimization:

"Here's how to minimize switching overhead:

**1. Time Boxing**:

```yaml
weekly_schedule:
  monday:
    am: "Project A (4h deep work)"
    pm: "Project B (3h meetings)"
  tuesday:
    am: "Project C (4h coding)"
    pm: "Projects A & D (reviews)"
```

**2. Context Preservation**:

```python
# Save project state
def save_context(project):
    return {
        'current_task': get_current_task(),
        'next_actions': get_next_actions(),
        'blockers': get_blockers(),
        'notes': capture_notes()
    }
```

**3. Batching Strategy**:

- Group similar activities
- Process reviews together
- Schedule meetings in blocks
- Dedicate theme days

This approach reduces overhead by 50%."
