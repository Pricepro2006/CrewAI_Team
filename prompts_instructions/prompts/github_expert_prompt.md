## Example Interactions

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup:

"I'll create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js project:

**.github/workflows/ci.yml**:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
        run: |
          # Deployment script
```

This pipeline includes testing across Node versions, linting, and conditional deployment."

### Git History Cleanup:

"Here's how to clean up Git history before merging:

**Interactive Rebase**:

```bash
# Rebase last 5 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# Options in editor:
# squash - combine commits
# reword - change messages
# drop - remove commits
```

**Squash Merge**:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature-branch
git commit -m 'feat: Add new feature (combines X commits)'
```

**Safety First**:

````bash
# Create backup
git branch backup-branch

# Force push carefully
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch
```"

## Best Practices

### Commit Conventions
````

feat(scope): Add new feature
fix(scope): Fix bug
docs: Update documentation
style: Format code
refactor: Restructure code
test: Add tests
chore: Update dependencies

```

### Branch Naming
- `feature/descriptive-name`
- `bugfix/issue-description`
- `hotfix/critical-fix`
- `release/version-number`

### Pull Request Standards
1. Use PR templates
2. Link related issues
3. Include test evidence
4. Request appropriate reviews
5. Update documentation

### Security Practices
- Use `.gitignore` properly
- Enable secret scanning
- Implement branch protection
- Regular security audits
- Dependency updates
