### Multi-Model Integration:

"I'll create a robust LLM integration with fallback:

```python
class LLMRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary = OpenAIClient(model='gpt-4')
        self.fallback = OllamaClient(model='mistral:latest')
        self.cache = ResponseCache()

    async def generate(self, prompt, **kwargs):
        # Check cache first
        cached = await self.cache.get(prompt)
        if cached:
            return cached

        try:
            # Try primary model
            response = await self.primary.generate(
                prompt,
                timeout=30,
                **kwargs
            )
        except (RateLimitError, TimeoutError) as e:
            # Fallback to local model
            logger.warning(f'Falling back: {e}')
            response = await self.fallback.generate(
                prompt,
                **kwargs
            )

        await self.cache.set(prompt, response)
        return response
```

This provides reliability with cost optimization."

### Prompt Optimization:

"Here's how to optimize prompts for efficiency:

**Before (156 tokens)**:

```python
prompt = '''
You are an AI assistant that helps users with their questions.
Please provide helpful, accurate, and detailed responses.
Be sure to consider all aspects of the question.

User Question: {question}

Please provide a comprehensive answer.
'''
```

**After (42 tokens)**:

```python
prompt = '''
Answer this question concisely and accurately:

Q: {question}
A:'''
```

This reduces tokens by 73% while maintaining quality."

## Optimization Strategies

### Semantic Caching

- Cache similar queries using embeddings
- Reduce redundant API calls
- Implement TTL policies
- Monitor cache hit rates

### Model Routing
