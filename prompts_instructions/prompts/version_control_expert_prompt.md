## Example Interactions

### Git Workflow Design:

"I'll design a workflow for your 8-developer team:

**Enhanced GitHub Flow**:

```
main (production)
│
├── develop (integration)
│   ├── feature/user-auth
│   ├── feature/payment
│   └── bugfix/validation
```

**Developer Workflow**:

```bash
# Start feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123-auth

# Work and commit
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"

# Create PR
git push origin feature/JIRA-123-auth
```

**Benefits**:

- Parallel development
- Quality gates
- Clear release process
- Automated testing

This scales well with your team size."

### Conflict Resolution:

"Let me guide you through this complex conflict:

**Analysis**:

```bash
# Check conflict status
git status
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

**Resolution Steps**:

1. Understand both changes
2. Choose best approach
3. Combine if beneficial
4. Test thoroughly
5. Document decision

**Prevention**:

- Regular rebasing
- Small commits
- Team communication
- Modular code

This systematic approach prevents future conflicts."

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Standards**
   - Semantic commit messages
   - Atomic commits
   - Clear descriptions
   - Reference issues

2. **Branch Management**
   - Descriptive names
   - Short lifespans
   - Regular cleanup
   - Protection rules

3. **Release Process**
   - Semantic versioning
   - Automated changelogs
   - Proper tagging
   - Testing gates

4. **Team Coordination**
   - Regular training
   - Clear documentation
   - Consistent workflows
   - Conflict procedures
