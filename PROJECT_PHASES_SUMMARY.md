## Detailed Phase Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Backend Core Implementation (100%)

- Master Orchestrator with plan/replan loop
- Agent system with specialized agents
- RAG system with ChromaDB support
- Tool framework implementation
- Database setup with SQLite

### ✅ Phase 2: Service Layer Implementation (95%)

- ConversationService with SQLite storage
- TaskService with MaestroFramework
- RAGService with document management
- AgentService with monitoring
- Missing: Service health checks and caching

### 🚧 Phase 3: API Implementation (80%)

- tRPC routers implemented
- Middleware stack (auth, rate limiting, logging)
- All CRUD endpoints functional
- Missing: WebSocket implementation, health endpoints

### ✅ Phase 4: Frontend Implementation (90%)

- All placeholder components replaced
- Real backend connection established
- Dark theme and responsive design
- Missing: WebSocket client, accessibility features

### 🚧 Phase 5: Integration & Testing (25%)

- Basic test infrastructure set up
- Unit tests need fixing after refactor
- E2E tests with Playwright configured
- Missing: Comprehensive test coverage

### 📅 Phase 6: Production Features (0%)

- Authentication & authorization
- Advanced RAG features
- Data collection pipeline
- Monitoring & observability
- Enterprise features

## Current Priority Tasks

1. **Fix failing unit tests** (Phase 5)
2. **Implement WebSocket** (Phase 3 & 4)
3. **Complete health checks** (Phase 3)
4. **Improve test coverage** (Phase 5)
5. **Start authentication system** (Phase 6)

## Key Achievements

✅ **Production-Ready Core**

- All core systems implemented
- Real LLM integration working
- Database fully integrated
- Frontend connected to backend

✅ **Removed Technical Debt**

- All mock servers removed
- Placeholder components replaced
- TypeScript errors mostly resolved
- Proper error handling throughout

✅ **Infrastructure**

- CI/CD pipeline configured
- Git hooks for code quality
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modular architecture

## Upcoming Milestones

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)

- Complete test suite fixes
- Implement WebSocket for real-time
- Add authentication system
- Deploy to staging environment

### Medium Term (1 month)

- Data collection pipeline
- Advanced RAG features
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

### Long Term (3 months)

- Full production deployment
- Enterprise features
- Horizontal scaling
- Multi-tenant support

## Risk Areas

⚠️ **Technical Risks**

- Test coverage is low (needs immediate attention)
- No authentication system yet
- WebSocket implementation pending
- Performance not yet optimized

⚠️ **Operational Risks**

- No monitoring in place
- Backup strategy not implemented
- Disaster recovery not planned
- Security audit needed

## Resource Requirements

### Immediate Needs

- Fix test infrastructure
- Implement WebSocket
- Add authentication

### Future Needs

- Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Redis for caching
- Load balancer setup
- CDN for static assets

## Success Metrics

### Current State

- ✅ Core functionality: 100%
- ✅ API endpoints: 80%
- ⚠️ Test coverage: 25%
- ✅ Documentation: 90%
- ⚠️ Production readiness: 60%

### Target State

- Test coverage > 80%
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero critical vulnerabilities

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Continue fixing unit tests
2. **This Week**: Complete WebSocket implementation
3. **Next Week**: Start authentication system
4. **This Month**: Deploy to staging with monitoring
