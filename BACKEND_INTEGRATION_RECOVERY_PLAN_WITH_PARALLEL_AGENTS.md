# Backend Integration Recovery Plan with Parallel Agent Workflows

## Executive Summary
This plan incorporates parallel and sequential agent workflows to maximize efficiency in resolving backend integration issues. Each phase deploys specialized agents in parallel for error fixing, followed by double-review cycles, and concludes with sequential documentation and version control.

## Agent Deployment Strategy

### Parallel Execution Groups
1. **Code Fix Agents** (4-6 agents working simultaneously on different file sets)
2. **Review Agents** (Second wave reviewing first agents' work)
3. **Sequential Finalization** (Documentation and Git agents)

### Double-Review Protocol
- Each file undergoes two reviews by different agents
- Tracking system monitors error counts at each stage
- Files marked complete after second review (even if errors remain)

---

## Phase 1: Fix Build Errors (IMMEDIATE)

### 1.1 Initial File Distribution

#### **File Assignment for Parallel Agents**

**Agent 1: /typescript-pro**
```
Files to debug:
1. src/tests/EmailChainAnalyzer.test.ts (26 syntax errors)
   - Lines: 443, 531, 537, 555, 571, 587
2. src/core/monitoring/ErrorTracker.ts (import path error)
3. src/core/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.ts (import path error)
```

**Agent 2: /code-reviewer**  
```
Files to debug:
1. src/tests/EmailChainAnalyzer.test.ts (continuing)
   - Lines: 604, 628, 639, 650, 664, 669
2. src/core/monitoring/SystemHealthMonitor.ts (import path error)
3. src/core/monitoring/AlertManager.ts (import path error)
```

**Agent 3: /debugger**
```
Files to debug:
1. src/tests/EmailChainAnalyzer.test.ts (continuing)
   - Lines: 683, 722, 756, 793, 827, 852
2. src/walmart/microservices/nlp-service/index.ts (logger path)
3. src/walmart/microservices/pricing-service/index.ts (logger path)

### 1.2 Parallel Execution Commands

```bash
# Execute all agents in parallel for Phase 1
/typescript-pro Fix syntax errors in EmailChainAnalyzer.test.ts lines 443-587 and import paths in monitoring modules
/code-reviewer Fix syntax errors in EmailChainAnalyzer.test.ts lines 604-669 and import paths in monitoring modules  
/debugger Fix syntax errors in EmailChainAnalyzer.test.ts lines 683-852 and logger paths in microservices
/error-resolution-specialist Fix remaining syntax errors and import issues in assigned files
```

### 1.3 Second Wave Review

After first wave completes, deploy review agents on completed files:

```bash
# Second wave reviews (different agents review first wave's work)
/code-reviewer Review and fix any remaining issues in files processed by typescript-pro
/typescript-pro Review and fix any remaining issues in files processed by code-reviewer
/error-resolution-specialist Review and fix any remaining issues in files processed by debugger
/debugger Review and fix any remaining issues in files processed by error-resolution-specialist
```

## Execution Timeline

### Estimated Time per Phase (with Parallel Execution)

| Phase | Sequential Time | Parallel Time | Time Saved |
|-------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 15 minutes | 5 minutes | 10 minutes |
| Phase 2 | 10 minutes | 3 minutes | 7 minutes |
| Phase 3 | 30 minutes | 10 minutes | 20 minutes |
| Phase 4 | 20 minutes | 7 minutes | 13 minutes |
| Phase 5 | 45 minutes | 15 minutes | 30 minutes |

## Risk Mitigation

### Parallel Execution Risks
1. **File Conflicts**: Agents working on same file simultaneously
   - **Mitigation**: Clear file assignment boundaries
   
2. **Dependency Issues**: One fix breaking another
   - **Mitigation**: Double-review protocol catches issues
   
3. **Communication Overhead**: Agents not sharing context
   - **Mitigation**: Sequential documentation phase captures all changes

### Contingency Plans
- If parallel agents conflict: Switch to sequential for that file
- If errors persist after double review: Mark as known issue, continue
- If critical blocker found: All agents focus on that issue
