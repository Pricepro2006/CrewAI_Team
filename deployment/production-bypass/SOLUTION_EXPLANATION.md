# Understanding and Solving the Python distutils Issue

## The Root Cause

The error you're encountering is due to Python's removal of the `distutils` module:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'
```

This happens because:
1. **Python 3.12+**: Completely removed `distutils` module (PEP 632)
2. **Python 3.11**: Some distributions ship without `distutils` to prepare for removal
3. **node-gyp**: Still depends on `distutils` for building native Node.js modules

## Why This Affects better-sqlite3

`better-sqlite3` is a native Node.js module that requires compilation. The compilation process uses:
- `node-gyp`: Node.js native build tool
- Python: Used by node-gyp for the build process
- `distutils`: Python module that node-gyp depends on

## Proper Solutions

### Solution 1: Install distutils Package (Ubuntu/Debian)

For systems with package managers:

```bash
# For Python 3.11 and below
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-distutils

# For specific Python version
sudo apt-get install python3.11-distutils
```

### Solution 2: Use setuptools (Python 3.12+)

Since distutils was merged into setuptools:

```bash
# Install setuptools
python3 -m pip install setuptools

# For node-gyp compatibility
export SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib
```

### Solution 3: Use Prebuilt Binaries

Avoid compilation entirely:

```bash
# Install with prebuilt binaries
npm install better-sqlite3 --build-from-source=false

# Or download manually from GitHub releases
# https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/releases
```

### Solution 4: Use Compatible Python Version

```bash
# Install Python 3.10 (has distutils)
sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3.10-distutils

# Configure npm to use it
npm config set python /usr/bin/python3.10
```

## The Quick Fix Script

I've created a comprehensive fix script that:

1. **Detects** your Python version and the specific issue
2. **Provides** multiple solution options
3. **Implements** the chosen solution
4. **Verifies** the fix worked

Run it with:
```bash
./deployment/production-bypass/fix-distutils-properly.sh
```

## For Your Production Deployment

### Option A: Fix the Environment
1. Run the fix script to resolve distutils
2. Rebuild better-sqlite3: `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`
3. Deploy normally

### Option B: Use Prebuilt Binaries
1. Copy node_modules from a working installation
2. Use the deployment script that skips compilation
3. Deploy without npm install

### Option C: Docker/Container Solution
1. Use a base image with Python 3.10
2. Pre-install all dependencies
3. Copy only the built artifacts

## Why the Workaround Isn't Ideal

While bypassing compilation works, it's better to fix the root cause because:

1. **Security**: Can't apply security patches without rebuilding
2. **Compatibility**: Prebuilt binaries might not match your exact environment
3. **Performance**: Native compilation can optimize for your specific CPU
4. **Maintenance**: Future updates require the same workarounds

## Recommended Production Approach

For production, I recommend:

1. **Standardize Python Version**: Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 with distutils
2. **Use CI/CD**: Build in CI with proper environment, deploy artifacts
3. **Container-based Deployment**: Ensures consistent environment
4. **Document Requirements**: Clear Python and system dependencies

## The Modern Solution

For new projects, consider:

1. **Different Database Library**: Some alternatives don't require native compilation
2. **WebAssembly SQLite**: Runs in JavaScript, no compilation needed
3. **External Database**: Use PostgreSQL/MySQL instead of embedded SQLite
4. **Managed Services**: Use cloud databases to avoid local dependencies

## Summary

The distutils issue is a known problem in the Node.js ecosystem. While we can work around it, the proper solution is to ensure your environment has the necessary Python dependencies. The script I've provided offers multiple ways to fix this permanently rather than just working around it.
