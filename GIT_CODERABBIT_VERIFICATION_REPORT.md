# Git Best Practices & CodeRabbit Integration Verification Report

**Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Project:** AI Agent Team Framework

---

## Executive Summary

This report confirms that the project follows git best practices and has properly integrated CodeRabbit for automated code review. The configuration is comprehensive and aligned with 2025 best practices for TypeScript/React projects.

---

## Git Configuration Status ✅

### 1. Version Control Structure

**Branch Strategy:**
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branch: `feature/production-implementation` (current)
- Development branches follow pattern: `feature/*`

**Git Status:**
- 28 modified files tracked
- 17 new untracked files
- Clean commit history with descriptive messages

### 2. .gitignore Configuration ✅

**Properly Ignored:**
- Dependencies: `node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`
- Build artifacts: `dist/`, `build/`
- Environment files: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`
- Data/databases: `data/`, `*.db`, `*.sqlite`
- IDE files: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`
- Test coverage: `coverage/`
- Temporary files and caches

**Best Practices Followed:**
- Keeps `pnpm-lock.yaml` (correct for pnpm)
- Excludes other lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`)
- Ignores local Ollama models and MCP configurations
- Excludes SSL certificates and backup files

### 3. Git Hooks Configuration ✅

**Husky Integration:**
- Pre-commit hook configured at `.husky/pre-commit`
- Runs lint-staged for automatic code formatting
- TypeScript checking temporarily disabled (known issue)

**Lint-staged Configuration:**
```json
{
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
  "*.{json,md,yml,yaml}": ["prettier --write"],
  "*.{css,scss}": ["prettier --write"]
}
```
