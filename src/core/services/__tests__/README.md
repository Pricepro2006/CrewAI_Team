## Performance Benchmarks

### Throughput Requirements
- ✅ **Target:** 60+ emails/minute
- ✅ **Small Batch (100 emails):** Meets requirement
- ✅ **Large Batch (500 emails):** Meets requirement  
- ✅ **High Concurrency (200 emails):** Exceeds requirement
- ✅ **Rapid Processing (500 emails):** Meets requirement

### Latency Requirements
- ✅ **Average:** <100ms per email
- ✅ **P95:** <200ms
- ✅ **P99:** <500ms

### Memory Efficiency
- ⚠️ **Current:** ~69KB per iteration (needs optimization)
- 🎯 **Target:** <1KB per iteration

## Known Issues & Recommendations

### Issues Identified (6 failing tests)
1. **Deduplication Logic:** Not detecting duplicates correctly in batch scenarios
2. **Worker Crash Handling:** Shutdown throws errors instead of graceful handling
3. **Memory Management:** Long-running operations show memory growth
4. **Configuration Validation:** Too permissive for invalid configurations
5. **Performance Variance:** Memory pressure affects consistency

### Recommendations for Production
1. **Fix Deduplication:** Implement proper Redis-based duplicate detection
2. **Improve Error Handling:** Add try-catch blocks in shutdown procedures
3. **Memory Optimization:** Implement periodic cleanup in long-running operations
4. **Stricter Validation:** Add comprehensive configuration validation
5. **Monitoring:** Add memory usage alerts for production deployment

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# For integration tests, start Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npx vitest src/core/services/__tests__/EmailIngestionService.test.ts
npx vitest src/core/services/__tests__/EmailIngestionService.integration.test.ts
npx vitest src/core/services/__tests__/EmailIngestionService.performance.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npx vitest --coverage
```

### Test Configuration
Tests use realistic delays and processing times:
- Repository operations: 1ms delay
- Email processing: 5-25ms delay
- Queue operations: 10-60ms processing time

## Test Quality Metrics
