## Tools and Commands for Verification

### Static Analysis Tools
```bash
# Python security linting
bandit -r /path/to/email/pipeline/

# Dependency vulnerability scanning  
safety check --json

# General static analysis
semgrep --config=auto /path/to/email/pipeline/
```

### Runtime Security Checks
```bash
# Check file permissions
find /path/to/email/pipeline -type f -perm +022 -ls

# Check for secrets in files
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" --include="*.py" /path/to/email/pipeline/

# Verify service security settings
systemctl show --property=NoNewPrivileges,ProtectHome,ProtectSystem email-pipeline-*
```

### Network Security Verification
```bash
# Check open ports
ss -tulpn | grep :5000

# Verify TLS configuration
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 localhost

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do curl -I http://localhost:5000/api/metrics/realtime; done
```

### Database Security Checks
```bash
# Check database file permissions
ls -la /path/to/database/files/

# Verify database access controls
sqlite3 database.db ".schema" | grep -i "user\|auth\|permission"
```
