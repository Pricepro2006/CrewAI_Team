- ‚ùå Not suitable for real-time processing

#### qwen3:0.6b - Fast but Unreliable
**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Fastest processing (1.2s)
- ‚úÖ 100% critical email detection
- ‚úÖ Good entity extraction

**Critical Issues:**
- ‚ùå Over-classifies High emails as Critical
- ‚ùå Broken summary generation (outputs thinking process)
- ‚ùå Generic action suggestions

#### qwen3:1.7b - Not Suitable
**Critical Failures:**
- ‚ùå Only 20% accuracy (worst)
- ‚ùå 50% critical detection (missed critical emails!)
- ‚ùå Frequent "undefined" outputs
- ‚ùå Unreliable categorization

## Priority Detection Analysis

### Test Results by Priority Level

| Priority Level | Best Model | Accuracy |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| Critical | granite3.3:2b, granite3.3:8b, qwen3:0.6b | 100% |
| High | granite3.3:2b, granite3.3:8b | 100% |
| Medium | granite3.3:2b, qwen3:0.6b | 100% |
| Low | None | 0% (all models failed) |

### Key Insights

1. **Critical Email Detection**: Most models (except qwen3:1.7b) reliably detect critical emails
2. **Low Priority Confusion**: All models struggle with Low priority, often marking as Medium
3. **High Priority Over-classification**: Smaller models tend to over-classify as Critical

## Entity Extraction Performance

All models performed equally well on entity extraction:
- PO Numbers: 100% accuracy across all models
- Quote Numbers: 100% accuracy across all models  
- Order Numbers: 100% accuracy across all models
- Tracking Numbers: 100% accuracy across all models
- Customer Names: ~85% accuracy (regex-based)
- Amounts: 100% accuracy across all models

**Note:** Entity extraction appears to be primarily regex-based, not requiring advanced model capabilities.

## Production Recommendations

### üéØ Primary Recommendation: Use granite3.3:2b

```typescript
// Recommended configuration
const emailAnalysisConfig = {
  primaryModel: 'granite3.3:2b',    // Best accuracy/speed balance
  criticalBackup: 'granite3.3:8b',  // For critical validation
  entityExtraction: 'qwen3:0.6b',   // Fast entity-only extraction
};
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Standard Emails**: Use granite3.3:2b for all email analysis
2. **High-Volume Processing**: Consider hybrid approach:
   - Quick entity extraction with qwen3:0.6b
   - Priority validation with granite3.3:2b
3. **Critical Email Validation**: Double-check with keyword detection

### Sample Production Code

```typescript
async function analyzeEmailProduction(email: Email) {
  // Always use granite3.3:2b for reliable analysis
  const analysis = await granite3_3_2b.analyze(email);
  
  // Validate critical emails with keyword check
  if (email.subject.match(/URGENT|CRITICAL|ASAP/i)) {
    analysis.priority = 'Critical';
    analysis.urgency = 'Immediate';
  }
  
  return analysis;
}
```

## Performance Expectations

With granite3.3:2b in production:
- **Average Processing Time**: 3.3 seconds per email
- **Throughput**: ~1,090 emails per hour
- **Critical Detection Rate**: 100%
- **Overall Accuracy**: 80%
- **Entity Extraction**: 100%
