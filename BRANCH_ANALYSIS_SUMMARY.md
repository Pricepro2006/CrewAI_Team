# Branch Analysis Status Summary

## PHASE 1 ANALYSIS RESULTS

### feature/frontend-real-data: ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES
- TypeScript compilation: FAILED (30+ errors)
- Main issues: tRPC router type mismatches
- Status: NOT MERGE READY - needs type fixes

### feature/backend-services: ❌ SIMILAR ISSUES  
- TypeScript compilation: FAILED (same errors)
- Same type issues as frontend branch
- Status: NOT MERGE READY - needs schema fixes

### Root Cause Analysis:
The compilation errors are actually SHARED between branches because:
1. Both branches contain overlapping file changes
2. Type definition mismatches between MCP tools and schemas
3. tRPC router procedure definitions inconsistent

### Recommendation:
Fix type issues at the integration level rather than individual branches.
Proceed to Phase 2 integration testing to resolve systematically.
