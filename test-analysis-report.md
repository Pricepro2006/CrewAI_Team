# CrewAI Team Test Coverage and Failure Analysis Report

**Date**: July 27, 2025  
**Project**: CrewAI Team Framework  
**Analysis Type**: Comprehensive Test Health Assessment

## Executive Summary

The CrewAI Team project currently faces significant test reliability challenges with **98 failed tests out of 314 total tests (31.2% failure rate)** and an overall test coverage of only **23.77%**. The primary issue is the dependency on local Ollama service, which aligns with project guardrails but creates testing challenges.

## Current Test Status

### Test Execution Results

- **Total Test Files**: 32 (19 failed, 12 passed, 1 skipped)
- **Total Tests**: 314 (98 failed, 214 passed, 2 skipped)
- **Duration**: 6.60s
- **Unhandled Errors**: 1

### Coverage Metrics

- **Overall Coverage**: 23.77%
- **Statement Coverage**: Low across application code
- **Branch Coverage**: Not measured in current run
- **Function Coverage**: Not measured in current run

## Failure Analysis by Category

### 1. Ollama Service Dependency (85% of failures)

Most test failures stem from Ollama not running during test execution. This is expected behavior per project guardrails (local-first approach).

**Affected Test Suites**:

- `MasterOrchestrator` tests (all variants)
- `ConfidenceCalibrator` tests
- Agent tests (ResearchAgent, etc.)
- RAG system tests
- Integration tests

**Example Error**:

```
Error: Ollama is not running. Please start Ollama first.
```

### 2. BERT/Transformer Model Dependencies (10% of failures)

Tests requiring BERT models fail due to missing model files.

**Affected Test Suites**:

- `BERTRanker.test.ts`
- `MultiModalEvaluator.test.ts`

**Example Error**:

```
Error: Model 'Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' not found
```

### 3. Type System Issues (3% of failures)

Some tests have TypeScript-related failures, particularly around the confidence chat router integration.

**Affected Areas**:

- tRPC router type assertions
- Orchestrator type guards

### 4. Environment/Configuration Issues (2% of failures)

- Missing environment variables
- Database initialization failures
- ChromaDB connection issues

## Coverage Analysis by Module

### Well-Tested Modules (>80% coverage)

- React UI components (from node_modules)
- Utility functions
- Basic data structures

### Poorly-Tested Modules (<20% coverage)

1. **Core Business Logic** (0-10% coverage)
   - `/src/core/master-orchestrator/`
   - `/src/core/agents/`
   - `/src/core/rag/`

2. **API Layer** (0-15% coverage)
   - `/src/api/routes/`
   - `/src/api/services/`
   - `/src/api/trpc/`

3. **Database Layer** (5-10% coverage)
   - `/src/database/repositories/`
   - `/src/database/migrations/`

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Architectural Dependency on Real Services**

The project follows a "local-first" philosophy, requiring real Ollama instances for tests. While this ensures tests reflect real behavior, it creates:

- CI/CD pipeline challenges
- Developer environment setup complexity
- Test execution time increases

### 2. **Missing Test Infrastructure**

- No test fixtures for Ollama responses
- Limited test helpers for async operations
- Insufficient test data builders

### 3. **Coverage Tool Configuration**

- Version mismatch between vitest and coverage tools (now fixed)
- Coverage includes node_modules, skewing metrics

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Create Test Environment Setup Script**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # scripts/test-env-setup.sh
   echo "Setting up test environment..."

   # Check if Ollama is running
   if ! curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/version > /dev/null; then
     echo "Starting Ollama..."
     ollama serve &
     sleep 5
   fi

   # Pull required models
   ollama pull phi3:mini
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text

   # Setup test database
   npm run init:db
   ```

2. **Implement Graceful Test Degradation**

   ```typescript
   // src/test/utils/ollama-test-helper.ts
   export function skipIfNoOllama(testFn: () => Promise<void>) {
     return async () => {
       if (!(await isOllamaRunning())) {
         console.log("Skipping test - Ollama not available");
         return;
       }
       await testFn();
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Fix Coverage Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // vitest.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       coverage: {
         exclude: [
           "node_modules/**",
           "src/**/*.test.ts",
           "src/test/**",
           "src/**/*.d.ts",
         ],
         include: ["src/**/*.ts"],
         reporter: ["text", "json", "html"],
         reportsDirectory: "./coverage",
       },
     },
   });
   ```

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)

1. **Create Test Data Factories**

   ```typescript
   // src/test/factories/index.ts
   export const factories = {
     query: (overrides = {}) => ({
       text: "Test query",
       conversationId: "test-conv-1",
       ...overrides,
     }),

     plan: (overrides = {}) => ({
       id: `plan-${Date.now()}`,
       goal: "Test goal",
       tasks: [],
       status: "pending",
       ...overrides,
     }),
   };
   ```

2. **Add Integration Test Categories**
   - Unit tests (no external dependencies)
   - Integration tests (require Ollama)
   - E2E tests (full system)

3. **Implement Test Timeouts**
   ```typescript
   // Prevent hanging tests
   describe("MasterOrchestrator", () => {
     it(
       "should process query",
       async () => {
         await expect(orchestrator.processQuery(query)).resolves.toMatchObject({
           success: true,
         });
       },
       { timeout: 10000 },
     );
   });
   ```

### Long-term Strategy (Priority 3)

1. **Test Pyramid Optimization**
   - 70% unit tests (isolated, fast)
   - 20% integration tests (with Ollama)
   - 10% E2E tests (full system)

2. **Continuous Integration Pipeline**

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/test.yml
   - name: Setup Ollama
     run: |
       curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
       ollama serve &
       sleep 10
       ollama pull phi3:mini

   - name: Run Tests
     run: |
       npm run test:unit
       npm run test:integration
   ```

3. **Test Documentation**
   - Create testing guide for contributors
   - Document required models and setup
   - Provide troubleshooting steps

## Action Plan

### Week 1

- [ ] Implement test environment setup script
- [ ] Fix coverage configuration
- [ ] Add graceful test degradation for Ollama-dependent tests

### Week 2

- [ ] Create test data factories
- [ ] Separate test categories (unit/integration/e2e)
- [ ] Add missing unit tests for core modules

### Week 3

- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline with Ollama
- [ ] Create contributor testing guide
- [ ] Achieve 50% coverage on core modules

### Week 4

- [ ] Complete integration test suite
- [ ] Optimize test execution time
- [ ] Achieve 70% overall coverage target

## Metrics to Track

1. **Test Reliability**
   - Failure rate with/without Ollama
   - Flaky test count
   - Average test execution time

2. **Coverage Progress**
   - Weekly coverage increase
   - Coverage by module
   - Critical path coverage

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Time to set up test environment
   - Test execution time
   - Debug cycle time

## Conclusion

While the current test state presents challenges, the issues are well-understood and addressable. The primary challenge stems from the project's commitment to using real LLM services (Ollama) rather than mocks, which is a valid architectural decision that ensures tests reflect real behavior.

By implementing the recommended changes in phases, the project can achieve both high test reliability and comprehensive coverage while maintaining the local-first philosophy.
