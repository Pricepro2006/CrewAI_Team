# 2025 Best Practices for Real-Time Applications

## Real-Time Chat Architecture

### WebSocket Best Practices
1. Use singleton WebSocket service pattern
2. Implement auto-reconnection with max retry limits
3. Full-duplex communication over single TCP connection
4. Organize with rooms and namespaces for group communications
5. Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) in production
6. Implement proper CORS handling

### Performance Optimization
- Handle thousands of concurrent connections
- Instant data transfer without polling
- Efficient connection management
- Low latency design

### React Integration
- Lift state management to App component
- Event-driven architecture with consistent naming
- Handle connection states and errors gracefully

## ChromaDB Vector Search Integration

### Setup and Configuration
- Use Docker for production deployment
- Client-server architecture with proper API design
- Native embeddings with OpenAI, HuggingFace, or custom models

### Best Practices
- Implement proper chunking strategies
- Use metadata filtering for better search results
- Support multi-modal retrieval
- Performance optimization with proper indexing

### Security
- Use SSL-terminating proxies
- Implement authentication layer
- Regular maintenance and monitoring

## BrightData Web Scraping

### Integration Methods
1. BrightData SDK with API key authentication
2. Browser API for dynamic content
3. Proxy network with datacenter, residential, ISP, and mobile IPs

### Best Practices
- Handle anti-scraping mechanisms with proper User-Agent
- Ensure compliance - only scrape public data
- Use parallel requests for pagination
- Implement proper error handling and retries

### Modern Solutions
- Web Scraper APIs for structured data
- Web Unlocker for site management
- Scraping Browser compatible with Puppeteer/Playwright
- MCP server integration for seamless API usage

## General Integration Guidelines

### API Design
- Use TypeScript for end-to-end type safety
- Implement proper error handling with unified format
- Version your APIs for backward compatibility
- Document all endpoints thoroughly

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application metrics with Prometheus
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Health check endpoints for all services

### Security Considerations
- Authentication and authorization on all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits
