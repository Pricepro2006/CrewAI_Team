Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words are the truncation of dolorem ipsum. Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting since the 1960s, when advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets popularized it. Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker.","source":"duckduckgo","relevance":0.7,"metadata":{}},{"title":"Nonsense","url":"https://duckduckgo.com/c/Nonsense","snippet":"Nonsense","source":"duckduckgo","relevance":0.7,"metadata":{}},{"title":"Cicero","url":"https://duckduckgo.com/c/Cicero","snippet":"Cicero","source":"duckduckgo","relevance":0.7,"metadata":{}},{"title":"Filler text","url":"https://duckduckgo.com/c/Filler_text","snippet":"Filler text","source":"duckduckgo","relevance":0.7,"metadata":{}},{"title":"Latin words and phrases","url":"https://duckduckgo.com/c/Latin_words_and_phrases","snippet":"Latin words and phrases","source":"duckduckgo","relevance":0.7,"metadata":{}}],"provider":"Duckduckgo"}
