## Implementation Methodology

### 2025 Best Practices Integration

#### Version Control Standards
- **Branching Strategy:** Feature branches with PR reviews
- **Commit Messages:** Conventional Commits format
- **Code Review:** All changes via pull requests
- **Quality Gates:** Automated testing and linting

#### Documentation Standards
- **Living Documentation:** All docs in version control
- **Architecture Decision Records:** Document all major decisions
- **API Documentation:** Auto-generated from code
- **User Guides:** Comprehensive and tested

#### CI/CD Pipeline Standards
- **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Security Scanning:** Dependency and code analysis
- **Quality Metrics:** Code coverage and performance
- **Deployment Automation:** Staged deployments with rollback

### Risk Mitigation

#### High-Risk Areas
1. **Orchestrator Switch:** Backup current state before integration
2. **Database Changes:** Migration scripts and rollback plans
3. **API Changes:** Backward compatibility testing
4. **Performance Impact:** Before/after benchmarks

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental integration with testing at each step
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive rollback procedures
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
