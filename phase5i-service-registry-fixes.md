# Phase 5I - Service Registry TypeScript Fixes

## Overview
Fixed all 13 TypeScript errors in `/src/core/events/ServiceRegistry.ts` related to service registration, discovery, and management functionality.

## Files Modified
- `/src/core/events/ServiceRegistry.ts` - Complete TypeScript remediation

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Iterator Compatibility (5 errors)
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors with Set and Map iteration
**Solution**: Used `Array.from()` to convert iterables before iteration
- Fixed Set iteration in `discoverServices()` method
- Fixed Map iteration in `cleanupStaleServices()` method

### 2. Redis Client Return Types (8 errors)
**Problem**: Redis client methods could return undefined
**Solution**: Added default empty array fallbacks for all Redis operations
- `smembers()` calls now default to `[]`
- `keys()` calls now default to `[]`
- `hgetall()` calls now default to `{}`

### 3. Type Safety Improvements
**Problem**: Implicit any types in reduce operations
**Solution**: Added explicit type annotations
- Fixed reducer type in `selectWeighted()` method
- Fixed reducer type in `getStats()` method
- Added proper ServiceInfo type annotations

### 4. Logical Error Fix
**Problem**: Incorrect logical condition `healthyServices?.length || 0 === 0`
**Solution**: Fixed to proper condition `!healthyServices || healthyServices.length === 0`

## Technical Details

### Service Registry Functionality Preserved
- Service registration and heartbeat system
- Health checking and status monitoring
- Load balancing strategies (round-robin, least-connections, random, weighted)
- Service capability and event type tracking
- Advanced service querying and filtering
- Notification system for service state changes

### Type Safety Enhancements
- Proper handling of Redis async operations
- Explicit type annotations for all collection operations
- Safe iteration over Map and Set collections
- Null safety for optional values

## Results
- ✅ All 13 TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ Service registry functionality maintained
- ✅ Type safety improved throughout the module
- ✅ Redis operations properly typed with fallbacks

## Next Steps
- Continue with Phase 5J for remaining TypeScript fixes
- Monitor service registry behavior in production
- Consider adding unit tests for service discovery logic
