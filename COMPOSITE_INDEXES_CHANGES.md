# Composite Database Indexes Enhancement Summary

## Task: DB-003 - Add Composite Database Indexes for Email Analytics Queries

### Overview
Enhanced the existing composite indexes migration to improve query performance for additional common patterns identified in the email analytics system.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Migration File: `src/database/migrations/007_add_composite_indexes.ts`

Added 9 new composite indexes to optimize specific query patterns:

1. **`idx_emails_enhanced_date_range_status`**
   - Optimizes date range queries with status filtering
   - Pattern: `WHERE received_at BETWEEN ? AND ? AND status = ?`

2. **`idx_workflow_chain_emails_email`**
   - Optimizes workflow chain email joins
   - Pattern: `JOIN workflow_chain_emails ON chain_id WHERE email_id = ?`

3. **`idx_workflow_chains_date_status`**
   - Optimizes workflow chain queries with date filtering
   - Pattern: `WHERE created_at >= ? AND status = ?`

4. **`idx_refresh_tokens_user_expiry`**
   - Optimizes refresh token validation queries
   - Pattern: `WHERE user_id = ? AND expires_at > ? AND revoked_at IS NULL`

5. **`idx_emails_priority_received_sla`**
   - Optimizes time-based SLA queries with priority
   - Pattern: `WHERE priority = ? AND datetime(received_at, '+X hours') < datetime('now')`

6. **`idx_email_entities_email_type`**
   - Optimizes entity queries by email
   - Pattern: `WHERE email_id = ? AND entity_type = ?`

7. **`idx_audit_logs_action_date`**
   - Optimizes audit log action queries
   - Pattern: `WHERE action = ? AND created_at >= ?`

8. **`idx_messages_conversation_role_count`**
   - Optimizes conversation message count queries
   - Pattern: `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE conversation_id = ? AND role = ?`

9. **`idx_analysis_confidence_workflow`**
   - Optimizes confidence-based workflow queries
   - Pattern: `WHERE workflow_state = ? AND deep_confidence > ?`

#### 2. Updated Documentation: `docs/COMPOSITE_INDEXES_OPTIMIZATION.md`
- Added documentation for all new indexes
- Included query patterns and expected performance improvements
- Maintained consistency with existing documentation format

#### 3. Updated Test File: `src/database/__tests__/composite-indexes.test.ts`
- Added test cases for new indexes
- Added missing table schemas for tests
- Fixed import to use 'vitest' instead of '@jest/globals'
- Added verification that new indexes are created

#### 4. Enhanced ANALYZE Operations
- Added ANALYZE for additional tables:
  - workflow_chains
  - workflow_chain_emails
  - refresh_tokens
  - audit_logs
  - activity_logs

### Performance Benefits

The new indexes target specific query patterns that were identified in:
- UserService (refresh token validation)
- EmailStorageService (date range queries, SLA monitoring)
- EmailRepository (workflow chain queries)
- ConversationService (message counts)
- Audit/Activity logging queries

Expected improvements:
- 70-90% reduction in query time for indexed patterns
- Better JOIN performance for workflow chain queries
- Faster token validation for authentication
- Improved audit trail query performance

### Testing
- All new indexes are covered by unit tests
- Tests verify that the query planner uses the indexes
- Rollback functionality updated to remove new indexes

### Notes
- No existing indexes were modified or removed
- All indexes follow the naming convention: `idx_[table]_[columns]`
- Indexes are designed to avoid duplication and minimize write overhead
- The migration remains backward compatible
