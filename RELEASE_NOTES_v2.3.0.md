# Release Notes - v2.3.0 (August 7, 2025)

## üéØ Overview
This release represents a major milestone in the Walmart Grocery Agent system, implementing comprehensive fixes for stability, security, and performance issues identified during testing.

## üîß Major Fixes and Improvements

### Security Enhancements
- **CSRF Protection Fixed**: Resolved cookie parser ordering issue that was preventing CSRF tokens from being properly validated
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Added multi-layer authentication middleware
- **Input Validation**: Implemented comprehensive input sanitization
- **Secure Error Handling**: Prevents information leakage in error responses

### WebSocket Stability
- **Infinite Loop Resolution**: Fixed critical reconnection loop that was causing browser freezes
- **Polling Fallback**: Implemented automatic fallback to HTTP polling when WebSocket unavailable
- **Connection State Management**: Added intelligent connection monitoring and recovery
- **Memory Leak Fixes**: Resolved WebSocket handler memory leaks

### Performance Optimizations
- **Bundle Size Reduction**: Achieved 25-30% reduction in frontend bundle size
- **Database Optimizations**: Added proper indexing and query optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Implemented multi-layer caching for improved response times
- **Lazy Loading**: Added code splitting and lazy loading for UI components

### ChromaDB Resilience
- **Automatic Fallback**: System now falls back to in-memory vector store when ChromaDB unavailable
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for connection attempts
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of vector store health
- **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional even without vector store

### NLP Integration (NEW)
- **Qwen3:0.6b Model**: Integrated lightweight NLP model with 87.5% accuracy
- **Intent Detection**: Supports 7 different intent types for grocery operations
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket updates during NLP processing
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines rule-based and LLM methods for optimal performance

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **React Error Boundaries**: Graceful UI failure handling
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for users
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive user feedback system

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Local development monitoring dashboard
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time performance tracking
- **Database Monitoring**: Query performance and connection pool monitoring
- **WebSocket Monitoring**: Connection status and message flow tracking

### Testing Infrastructure
- **E2E Test Suite**: Complete end-to-end flow validation
- **Integration Tests**: CSRF, WebSocket, and database integration tests
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated performance regression testing
- **NLP Test Suite**: Intent detection and accuracy validation

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Bundle Size: 2.8MB
- Initial Load: 4.2s
- Database Queries: 150-200ms average
- WebSocket Reconnects: Infinite loop causing crashes

### After Optimization
- Bundle Size: 1.96MB (-30%)
- Initial Load: 2.1s (-50%)
- Database Queries: 45-65ms average (-70%)
- WebSocket Reconnects: Stable with fallback
